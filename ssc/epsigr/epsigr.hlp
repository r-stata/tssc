Unlike ^gphpen -deps^ there is nosuperfluous whitespace surrounding the graph. Furthermore it leaves nogph-file or ps-file behind.The command requires the program ^ps2epsi^ to be installed andavailable in the users default path. ^psepsi^ is part of Ghostscript5.50, see ^http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/^ for further reference.^epsigr^ can be viewed as a front-end to ^graph^ and if no ^saving^option is specified it behaves exactly like ^graph^.Options-------^saving(^filename[^,replace^]^)^ saves the graph in an epsi-file withdefault extension ^.eps^. ^gph^opt^(^string^)^ are options passed to ^gphpen^.All other options corresponds to the options allowed with ^graph^, seehelp ^graph^.Examples--------    . ^epsigr weight age^			(No file saved)    . ^epsigr weight age, sa(epsplot1)^    . ^epsigr weight age, sa(epsplot1,replace) gph(-n)^					      (No stata-logo)    . ^gr weight age, sa(gphfile)^	        (same as before, but					       based on previosly     . ^epsigr using gphfile, sa(epsplot2)^	 created graph)Author------	Henrik Stovring	University of Southern Denmark	Denmark	email: stovring@@isd.sdu.dkAlso see--------Manual: ^[G] graph^, ^[G] graph options^On-line: help for ^graph^, ^gphpen^.
