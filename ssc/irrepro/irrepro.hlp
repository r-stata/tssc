Pick one ball from theurn randomly, and replace it in the urn, together with a additionalballs of the same colour. Repeat indefinitely. What happens to (say) theproportion of white balls in the urn?Experiment indicates, and analysis confirms, that in any particularexperiment the proportion stabilises rapidly, but on an unrepeatablevalue. A set of experiments approximates a distribution of limitingproportions that is beta over the whole range from 0 to 1 (uniform if b= w = a = 1). In effect, early choices are crucial, even though eachhistory looks increasingly flat.^irrepro^ runs the experiment once and plots proportion white againstnumber of picks.^irrepron^ (think: ^irrepro^ run ^n^ times) runs the experiment for asmany times as there are observations. Under Windows, the effect is amovie with as many frames as there are observations.Remarks-------If there are no data in memory, ^irrepro^ sets the number ofobservations to 200. This is suggested as a suitable number.The user must have installed ^distplot^ previously.This model was discussed by Eggenberger and P\'olya (1923). Cohen (1976)and May (1976) give accessible discussions of the model and itsinterpretation.Options-------^black(^#^)^ specifies the number of black balls (default 1).^white(^#^)^ specifies the number of white balls (default 1).^add(^#^)^ specifies the number of balls to be added (default 1).^connect(^ ^)^ can be used to suppress connection of data points. The    default is ^l^.^symbol(^ ^)^ can be used to specify a plotting symbol. The default    is ^.^ (dot).^generate(^newvar^)^ can be used to save the results of n experiments    each producing a proportion white after n picks.graph_options refers to options of ^graph, twoway^ other than ^xla( )^    ^yla( ) gap( ) t1( )^.Examples--------    . ^irrepro^    . ^irrepron^References----------Cohen, J.E. 1976.
