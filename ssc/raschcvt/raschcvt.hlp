.-Help for ^raschcvt.-Convert Stata data to produce Rasch Winsteps data file and control file-----------------------------------------------------------------------.-^syntax ^raschcvt varlist, outfile() id() max() min(default = 0) xwide(default = 2)^.-Options-------^varlist^     The variables to be sent to the Winsteps. Enter the itemsfirst, then the ID and other variables. The order is crucial sincethe calculation of the number of items ends when the id variable isidentifed. Therefore Stata must be appropriately ordered beforeprogram is run.^outfile^     The path and file name. The extensions .dat and .conwill be added by the program and the files saved in the correct directory.^min^         The minimum value for the items. Default is 0^max^         The maximum value for the items.^xwide^       The width of the variables. The 'codes' and formatsare calculated on the basis of this value. The default value is 2.Comment-------This program expects the item values to be integers. The program alsoexpects the variables to be labeled. If this not the case, then edit.con file to remove references to the label. In that case the namesof the variables will take the place of the labels.The items must be converted to categories if they are not already incategory form. The data must be ordered by the Stata ^order^ program.The program will not work unless the following order is achieved:1) items 2) ID 3) secondary IDs and classification variables.If there are are secondarr IDs or classification variables, the programleaves a space between ID and the next ID variable/classification variable, and space between each variable after that. For Winsteps to use thesevraibles, the spaces that follow after the ID variable must be removed. Thisis easily done with a text editor (ie.TextPad for Windows), followd byresaving the file. Example-------raschcvt  dcat fcat acat gcat scat patkey newenc, outfile(c:\winsteps\testme) id(pa) max(21)Building Rasch files;The id variable is patkey;There are 5 items;Items and lengths;patkey 15 ;newenc 2 ;Start control file belowTITLE=DATA=c:\winsteps\testme.datITEM1=1NI=5NAME1=6DELIMITER = SPACEXWIDE=2CODES=00010203040506070809101112131415161718192021MAXPAG=60PRCOMP=SMUCON=0LCONV= .001RCONV= 1GROUPS=HLINES=Y;PSELECT= ?????1*;TABLES=11110110011111000001111;ISFILE=c:\winsteps\testme.isf;IFILE=c:\winsteps\testme.IFL;PFILE=c:\winsteps\testme.PFL;XFILE=c:\winsteps\testme.XFL&ENDdepressionfatigueanxietyGlobal SeveritySleepEND LABELSdcatfcatacatgcatscatEND NAMES
