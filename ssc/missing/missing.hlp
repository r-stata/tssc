..-help for ^missing^..-Examines and replaces missing values- ------------------------------------	^missing^ varlist ^, an^alysis ^me^thod^(^method-option^)^ [time-series-option ]Description- -----------^missing^ replaces missing values for the variables in ^varlist^Options- -------^an^alysis displays a table of association measures. Specifically,Simple andJaccard coefficients and their significance levels are calculated. Highcoefficient values correspond to strong relationships between variables.^me^thod^(^method-option^)^ specifies the method used for replacingmissing valuesin ^varlist^. Available methods are:    ^dr^op drops observations for which any variable takes on missingvalue.    ^im^pute makes use of the @impute@ ado file for performing bestsubset    regression. Since regression does not assume causality, eachvariable is    modelled as a combination of the rest.    ^in^ter^[^varname^]^ replaces missing values with linearinterpolations of the    existing values for each group defined by varname. When the missingvalues    are placed at the beginning (end) of the group, the first (last)available    value of that group is repeated. Interpolation only makes sense incase of    time-series. In order to sort by date the time-series option isrequired:	^da^te^(^date-variable^)^    ^me^an^[^varname^]^ replaces missing values with the mean value foreach    group defined by varname.    ^pr^edict fits (@fit@ command) a linear model to all the variablesin varlist    a replaces missing values with predicted (@predict@ command) values.Note    that this method does not assure that all the missing values arefilled in.Bibliography- ------------A.K.
