{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:confnd} plots and displays effect estimates using stepwise change-in-estimate 
method for assessing confounding. The first independent variable is the exposure of interest and all other independent variables are potential confounders. 

{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2} {cmd:eform} reports the estimated coefficients transformed to odds ratios, 
hazard ratios, relative risk i.e., exp(b) rather than b.  Confidence intervals are 
similarly transformed. 

{p 4 8 2}{opth format(%fmt)} specifies the display format for
presenting numbers in graph and table.  {cmd:format(%9.0g)} is the default. {p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd: forward} specifies the forward method, the backward method is the default. {p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{opth lockterms(varlist)} specifies variables to be included in all models.  {p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:vertical} plots vertical spike. The default is horizontal {p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{it:graph_options} refers to options of {help graph twoway scatter}.  {p_end}
