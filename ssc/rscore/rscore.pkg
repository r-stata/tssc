d 'RSCORE': module for estimation of responsiveness scores
d
d  rscore computes unit-specific responsiveness scores using an
d iterated Random-Coefficient-Regression (RCR).  The basic
"d econometrics of this model can be found in Wooldridge (2002, pp."
d 638-642).  The model estimated by rscore considers a regression
"d of a response variable y,  on a series of factors (or regressors)"
"d x, by assuming a different reaction (or   ""responsiveness"")  of"
d each unit to each factor contained in x. rscore allows for: (i)
d ranking units according to the  level of the responsiveness score
d obtained; (ii) detecting factors that are more influential in
"d driving unit performance;  (iii) studying, more in general, the"
d distribution (heterogeneity) of the factorsÂ’ responsiveness
d scores across units.
