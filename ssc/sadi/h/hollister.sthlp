{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:hollister} calculates localised Optimal Matching distances
between all pairs of sequences in the data, where {it:varlist} is a
consecutive set of variables describing the elements of the sequence. It
uses a Stata plugin implementation of Mattissa Hollister's adaptation of
the Needleman--Wunsch algorithm. Thanks to Mattissa for help in figuring
out to code it, but if I have introduced any errors they are my own.

{pstd}Hollister's measure differs from conventional OM by taking account
of the neighbours of tokens involved in OM's elementary operations.
While this is attractive from a sociological point of view, it means the
dissimilarity measure is not guaranteed to be metric. This is also true
of {help omav}.

{pstd}States must be numbered as consecutive integers from 1 up, and the
substitution cost matrix must be square, with dimension equal to the
number of states. States must not be missing.
