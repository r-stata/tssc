{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:omav} calculates duration-adjusted Optimal Matching
distances between all pairs of sequences in the data, where
{it:varlist} is a consecutive set of variables describing the
elements of the sequence. It uses a Stata plugin implementation of
an adapted Needleman{c -}Wunsch algorithm. It differs from the
standard {cmd:oma} command in that the costs of elementary
operations are reduced for tokens that are elements of runs of the
same value. By default, the cost of an operation on an element of
an n-element sequence is changed by a factor of 1/n^f where f is
given by the {opt:fac:exp} option. The value of f defaults to 0.5.
A value of f of zero produces the same result as {cmd:oma} and a
value of f of 1.0 weights all spells the same regardless of length. 

{pstd}Note: this measure is not guaranteed to be metric. 

{pstd}States must be numbered as consecutive integers from 1 up, and the
substitution cost matrix must be square, with dimension equal to the
number of states. States must not be missing.
