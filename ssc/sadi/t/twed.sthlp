{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:twed} calculates Marteau's Time-Warp Edit Distance (TWED)
between all pairs of sequences in the data, where {it:varlist} is a
consecutive set of variables describing the elements of the sequence.
Time-warping stretches and compresses the time dimension to achieve
alignment in a manner similar but not identical to {help oma}'s
insertion and deletion. Marteau (2007) describes a time-warping
algorithm with a stiffness parameter (nu) and a gap penalty (lambda)
which is metric as long as nu>0 (many time-warping distances are not
metric). Because it uses compression instead of deletion, it respects
the spell structure of the trajectory more than {help oma} does. It uses
a matching cost operation that is very close to OMA's substitution
operation. The algorithm also differs by comparing adjacent pairs of
elements in each sequence, rather than single elements.

{pstd}
It uses a Stata plugin implementation.

{pstd}States must be numbered as consecutive integers from 1 up, and the
substitution cost matrix must be square, with dimension equal to the
number of states. States must not be missing.
