{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:combinadd} calculates a version of Elzinga's
duration-weighted number of common subsequences measure for
spell-structured data. The variable list must identify the spell
structure in the form state-1, duration-1, state-2, duration-2, ...
state-X, duration-X where X is the maximum number of spells observed.
The nspells option identifies the variable that stores the case-specific number of spells.

{pstd}States must be numbered as integers from 1 up.

{pstd} The measure counts the number of spell sub-sequences common to
each pair of sequences, weighted by the combined duration of the
subsequence. The number of subsequences in a sequence increases very
rapidly with the length of the sequence, with major consequences for
memory demands. This implementation can handle sequences with of the
order of 15 spells without too much difficulty. The maxtuples limit
causes the command to stop if too many subsequences are observed, in
order to avoid running out of memory. The maxtuples option can be used
to judiciously raise this limit.

{pstd} It uses a Stata plugin implementation.{p_end}

{pstd} See {help combinprep} for a way of converting calendar
representations to spell representations.{p_end}
