The denominatorscan be interpreted as two different estimates of the errorvariance of the estimated equation, both of whichare consistent (see Davidson and MacKinnon (1993), pp. 235-36).{p}Both statistics are distributed as chi-square with L-K degrees of freedom.Both can be calculated via an artificial regressionof the residuals of the IV estimation regressed on thefull set of instruments;the Sargan statistic is N * the uncentered R-sq from this regression.See, e.g., Davidson and MacKinnon (1993), p. 236 and Wooldridge(2002), p. 123. {p}If there are no overidentifying restrictions (i.e., in the case of exact identification, where the number of excluded instruments equals the number of right-hand endogenous variables), an error message is printed.{p}The version of this test that is robust to heteroskedasticityin the errors is Hansen's J statistic;under the assumption of conditional homoskedasticity,Sargan's statistic becomes Hansen's J (see Hayashi (2000), p. 227-28),and hence the two statistics are sometimes referred toas the Hansen-Sargan statistic.Robust overidentification statistics are available via{cmd:ivreg2}. {cmd:overid} will not produce a resultif either the {cmd:robust} or {cmd:cluster} optionsare employed in the preceding IV regression.{cmd:ivreg2} also provides "diff-Sargan" or "C" tests for the endogeneity of a subset of instruments; see help {help ivreg2} (if installed) for details.{p}The test will fail to run if N<L. For Z'Z to be of full rank, N>L.{dlgtab :Instrumental variables probit and Tobit}{p}{cmd:overid} will report an overidentification statistic after estimation by{cmd:ivprobit} and {cmd:ivtobit} with the twostep option.  These Statacommands request Newey's (1987) minimum-distance (orminimum-chi-squared) IV probit and IV Tobit estimators, respectively.Lee (1992) shows that the minimized distance for these estimatorsprovides a test of overidentifying restrictions.  Like Sargan andBasmann single-equation statistics, the test statistic is distributed asChi-squared with (L-K) degrees of freedom under the null that theinstruments are valid.  The test statistic is available after twostepestimation only.{dlgtab:Three-stage least squares}{p}{cmd:overid} will report an overidentification statistic after system estimationwith {cmd:reg3}. As Davidson and MacKinnon (2004, p.532) indicate, a Hansen-Sargantest of the overidentifying restrictions is based on the 3SLS criterion functionevaluated at the 3SLS point and interval parameter estimates. Under the nullhypothesis, the statistic is distributed Chi-squared wih (G*L - K) degrees offreedom, where G is the number of simultaneous equations. The procedure will takeproper account of linear constraints on the parameter vector imposed during estimation. {dlgtab:General comments}{p}The command displays the test statistics, degrees of freedom and P-value,and places values in the return array. {cmd:return list} for details.{p}A full discussion of these computations and related topicscan be found in Baum, Schaffer, and Stillman (2003) and Baum, Schaffer andStillman (2006). A version of this routine by Schaffer and Stillman that works in the context of panel data is available as {cmd:xtoverid}.{dlgtab:Citation}{p}{cmd:overid} is not an official Stata command.
