If not, then use      ^set maxvar=x^ command to make adjustment.       The final weighted logistic regression displays p-values based ont-statistics per recommendation of D. Collett (1991), Modeling Binary Data,Chapman & Hall, p 196.The Williams procedure iteratively reduces the Chi2-based dispersion to approximately 1.0. An extra parameter, called ^phi^, is used to scale the  variance function. It changes with each iteration. The value of phi which results in a chi2-based dispersion of 1.0 is then used to weight a standardgrouped logistic regression. The weighting formula is: 1/(1+(m-1)*phi) where m is the binomial denominator.CHI2 = -2(LL0 - LLf): p-value evaluates the null hypothesis that allcoefficients in the model, except the intercept, equal 0. Degree of freedom isthe number of predictors. CHI2 is to be distinguished from the traditional GLMChi2 which is defined as SUM{(y-mu)^^2/V} where V=variance.Pseudo R2 = 1-LLf/LL0: This is standard Stata output; however there are several alternative R2 formulations in common use.For additional information contact: Joseph Hilbe, email: hilbe@@asu.edu
