The table is presented with row and column names taken from the specified matrix. Thus, one need only generate the appropriate matrix using standard Stata commands. By default, only the lower triangle of a symmetric matrix willbe written unless the {cmd:nosym} option is used.{p}The {cmd:using} clause is required, and must specify the name of a file to which the LaTeX table is to be written, without the {bf:.tex} extension. If the file exists, either the {cmd:replace} option or the {cmd:append} option must be specified. {p}The {cmd:mat} qualifier specifies the name of the existing matrix which is to be written in tabular form.{title:Options}{p 0 4}{cmd:replace} specifies that if {it:filename} exists, it should be overwritten with the contents of {it:mat}. {p 0 4}{cmd:append} specifies that output should be appended to an existing {it:filename}. It may be used even if the file has not been previously created.{p 0 4}{cmd:nobox} specifies that the default behavior of providing borders for each cell of the table should not be applied.{p 0 4}{cmd:center} specifies that elements in the second and following columns of the table should be centered, rather than flush left.{p 0 4}{cmd:asis} specifies that the row and column names of {it:mat} should be passed through to the TeX file without alteration. This permits use of the underscore (_) to create subscripts in row or column headings. However, if the names of regressors are being used as labels, the default label {it:_cons} should be changed.{p 0 4}{cmd:caption} specifies a caption to be produced above the table. The table will beautomatically numbered according to the style of the document. {p 0 4}{cmd:format} specifies the format to be applied to the elements in the body of the table, which will then override the default format used to display matrix elements.{p 0 4}{cmd:norowlab} suppresses the row labels. {p 0 4}{cmd:nosym} forces the matrix to be treated as general, and not symmetric. {title:Examples}	{inp:. use auto}	{inp:. forv r=2/5 {c -(} }	{inp:.		qui reg price headroom-turn if rep78==`r'}	{inp:.		mat c`r'=e(b)'}	{inp:.		}}	{inp:.	mat c=c2,c3,c4,c5}	{inp:.	mat colnames c=rep78_2 rep78_3 rep78_4 rep78_5}		{inp:.	outtable using cars,mat(c) replace}		{inp:.	outtable using cars,mat(c) append center f(%9.2f)}		{inp:.	outtable using cars,mat(c) replace c }		{inp:		cap("Regression coefficients by rep78")}		{title:Author}Christopher F Baum, Boston College, baum@bc.edu{title:Acknowledgements}This command was made possible by Bill Gould's implementation of the file command, and inspired by conversations with Petia Petrova. David Drukker's and Alan Feiveson's suggestions have improved its functionality.{title:Also see}{p 0 19}On-line:  help for {help file}, {help outseries} (if installed), {help tosql} (if installed){p_end}
