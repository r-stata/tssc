Stata 8 users should use ^skewplot^ 3.0.0 or later. Remarks-------Order n data values for a variable x and label them such that x_(1) <= ... <= x_(n). In a perfectly symmetric set of data, the midsummaries 	(x_(1) + x_(n)) / 2, 	(x_(2) + x_(n - 1)) / 2, 	etc. would all be identical, and equal to the median. A plot of each midsummary 	(x_(i) + x_(n - i + 1)) / 2versus each difference or spread 	x_(n - i + 1) - x_(i) would yield a horizontal straight line. Conversely, skewness in sets of data will be reflected by departures from horizontality.Apart from the divisor of 2, this plot was suggested by J.W. Tukey (Wilk and Gnanadesikan 1968). See also Gnanadesikan (1977, Ch.6.2) or Fisher (1983). The form used here and the name `mid versus spread plot' are found in Hoaglin (1985). It is usual to plot only that half of the sample results for which spread is >= 0. The ^skew^ option produces an alternative form promoted by Benjamini and Krieger (1996, 1999). The identity 	x_(n - i + 1) = median  	              + (x_(n - i + 1) - x_(i)) / 2                       + (x_(i) + x_(n - i + 1) - 2 * median) / 2 	              = median + spread function + skewness function 	for x_(i) in the lower half of the sample leads to a plot of the skewness function versus the spread function, known as the skewness versus spread plot. Note that the skewness function is midsummary - median, and will be constant and zero for a perfectly symmetric distribution, and that the spread function is half the spread of the mid versus spread plot.In addition, the ratio of the skewness and spread functions or	x_(i) + x_(n - i + 1) - 2 * median	----------------------------------              x_(n - i + 1) - x_(i)is a measure of skewness (in the traditional sense) originally suggested for quartiles by Bowley (1902) and generalised to this form by David and Johnson (1956). It varies between -1 and 1. A similar general measure was used by Parzen (1979). Graphically this measure is the slope of the line connecting (0,0) and each data point. See Benjamini and Krieger (1996, 1999) and Groeneveld (1998) for concise reviews tracing such ideas from late 19th century antecedents to recent work and further details on the interpretation of the skewness versus spread plot. Options-------^skew^ specifies the skewness versus spread plot, not the default     mid versus spread plot. graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^.    Note that with ^by( )^ each group is treated graphically as if it    were a separate variable, so long as the number of groups is not    greater than the limit in Stata on the number of y variables on a    scatter plot (20 in Stata 6.0).    With more groups, all functions must be treated graphically as a    single variable, by using the ^mono^ option, which enforces a    monochrome treatment. The only ^connect^ line style appropriate is    then ^c(L)^, and only one ^pen^ and point ^symbol^ may be used.    By default ^ysc( )^ and ^xsc( )^ show the extremes observed for each     variable. With the ^skew^ option, the maximum value of spread (smax,     say) can be used in a second pass with ^ysc(-^smax^,^smax^)^, which are     the limits on possible values for skewness. For example, if the     maximum value observed is ^12.34^, setting ^ysc(-12.34,12.34)^ gives a     y axis stretched to show extremes possible for skewness, corresponding    to limits for a Bowley-type measure of -1 and 1. ^by(^byvar^)^ specifies that calculations are to be carried out    separately for each group defined by ^byvar^. Any graph will,    however, show results for all groups. ^by( )^ is only allowed     with a single varname.^mono^ specifies a monochrome treatment, with a single ^pen^ colour,    ^connect^ style and point ^symbol^. See above, under graph_options.^missing^, used only with ^by( )^, permits the use of non-missing values    of varname corresponding to missing values for the variable named by    ^by( )^. The default is to ignore such values.Examples-------- . ^skewplot6 mpg^ . ^skewplot6 mpg, by(foreign) c(ll)^ . ^skewplot6 mpg, by(rep78) c(L) sy([rep78]) mono skew^  . ^skewplot6 length width height^References----------Benjamini, Y. and Krieger, A.M. 1996.
