.-help for ^zb_qrm^.-Recoding into binary variables multiple responses done by choice vars.-----------------------------------------------------------------------    ^zb_qrm^ rootch nch rootnew nnew Description------------^zb_qrm^ generates 'nnew' new binary variables according to thecode of the 'rootexist' variables. Usually multiplechoices are registred in variables representing first choice,second choice etc. The name of these variables are assumed to be numbered from 1 to the maximum number of choices. The 'rootch' parameter specifies the root-string in the names and the namesare 'rootch1' 'rootch2'. The same naming convention exists forthe new binary variables having the root string 'rootnew' andare numbered from 1 to 'nnew'. The codes in the existing variablesmust be the same. Missing values are allowed. The program zb_qrm print a frequency statistic of each code and one of the combinations of all codes.Remarks--------Parameters (no one is optional)-----------rootch :  Root string of 7 or fever characters which is the rootname           of the input vars.		  nch :     Number of input variables or choices.rootnew : Root string of 7 or fever characters which is the rootname          of the output vars.		  nnew :    Number of codes in the input variables and          number of output variablesBeside the new numbered output variable a new variable havingonly the 'rootnew' name will be created representingall combinations of the output variables.Example--------    . ^zb_qrm test 6 testb 15^	   	   This will analyse the variables test1-test6 and create	   testb1-testb15Author-------         Eric Zbinden         Zbinden@@cmu.unige.chAlso see---------help for @rccode@ if installed
