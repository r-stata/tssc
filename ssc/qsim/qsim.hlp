If xi: variables are not used, the automation process works without them.{title:Remarks}{p}Without {cmd:qsim} each of the 3 {cmd:clarify} programs has to be runseparately for each level of the xi: categorical variable. {cmd:qsim} canbe placed into one or more {cmd:foreach} loops and a large series of simulations can be run at one time.{p} The output can be pasted into a text editor. Marking {cmd:E(} identifiesthe line with the simulation data output. This line then can be cut to Excel (or similar programs) to make an output table. The whole process takes less than a minute.{p} The {cmd:levels} module of Nicholas J. Cox (available from the Boston College archives)is required to run {cmd:qsim} and is installed as part of this package.{title:Options}{p}{cmd:setx2()} expects the appropriate {cmd:clarify setx} commands. The contents of {cmdab:c:ommand} must be put in quotations.{p}{cmd:by()} expects one xi: variable. If left blank the programs runsas if there were no xi: variable. Do not enter the xi: variable in the{cmd:setx2()} option.{title:Examples}{p 4 8}{inp:. qsim, c("reg euroutil age sex white ra i.edcat") setx2(age 55 sex 1) by(edcat)} {p_end}{p 4 8}{input:. qsim, c("reg euroutil age sex white ra i.edcat") setx2(age 55)} {p_end}{title:Author}    Fred Wolfe, National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases, Wichita, KS      fwolfe@arthritis-research.org{title:Also see} {p 0 19}On-line help: {help clarify}, {help estsimp}, {help setx}, {help simqi}, if installed. {p_end}
