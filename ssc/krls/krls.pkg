d 'KRLS': module to perform Kernelâ€“Based Regularized Least Squares
d
"d  krls implements Kernel-Based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), a"
d machine learning method described in Hainmueller and Hazlett
d (2013) that allows users to solve regression and classification
d problems without manual specification search and strong
d functional form assumptions. The flexible KRLS estimator learns
d the functional form from the data and thereby protects inferences
"d against misspecification bias. Yet, it nevertheless allows for"
d interpretability and inference in ways similar to ordinary
"d regression models. In particular, KRLS provides closed-form"
"d estimates for the predicted values, variances, and the pointwise"
d partial derivatives that characterize the marginal effects of
d each independent variable at each data point in the covariate
d space. KRLS is thus a convenient and powerful alternative for
d problems requiring regression-based analyses. For more
