The number of persons            is only used to display the observation counts. ^M^ult      Multiplier for rates. Default 100.000. That is rates are counts/100000 time units.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Files are: cflpois.ado, cflpois.hlpLatest version accessible for download from http://www.bola.suite.dkExamples--------- . ^cflpois count pyrs . ^cflpois count pyrs, by(sex agegrp) N(persons) . ^cflpois count pyrs, mult(1000)  . ^cflpois count pyrs, by(sex agegrp kohort) Applying if in  . ^cflpois c1 pyrs if r > 0^  . ^cflpois c1 pyrs in 1/400^, by(v3) weights not tested ! Author-------         Jens M.Lauritsen, Accident Analysis Group, Odense University Hospital                           Odense Denmark. jm.lauritsen@@dadlnet.dkAlso see---------On-line: help for @cc@ @ir@  @epitab@
