.-help for ^chaos^.-Iterating a logistic difference equation----------------------------------------    ^chaos , r(^#^)^ [ ^c^onnect^(^str^) s^ymbol^(^str^)^  ]Description-----------^chaos^ iterates for 0 < r < 4 and t = 1, 2, 3, ...        x[t+1] = r * x[t] * (1 - x[t])starting with x[1] as a random number from the uniform distribution on[0,1).As r increases, the generic behaviour changes from tendency to a singleequilibrium to alternations between two equilibria, between fourequilibria, and so on, successive bifurcations leading to `chaos' forsufficiently large r.^chaos^ presents the user with graphs of x[t] versus t and of x[t+1]versus x[t].Remarks-------If there are no data in memory, ^chaos^ sets the number of observationsto 200. This is suggested as a suitable number.Options-------^r(^#^)^ is a required option setting r: 0 < r < 4.^connect(^ ^)^ can be used to suppress connection of data points. The    default is ^l^.^symbol(^ ^)^ can be used to specify a plotting symbol. The default    is ^.^Examples--------    . ^chaos, r(3.99)^    . ^chaos, r(3.99) c(.) sy(o)^Author------         Nicholas J.
