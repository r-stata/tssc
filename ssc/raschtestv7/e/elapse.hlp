..-help for ^elapse^..-Timing portions of a program- ----------------------------	^elapse^ start_time [name_of_operation]Where start_time is a previously defined macro equal to the global system macro S_TIME at some earlier point, and name_of_operation is a string.Description- -----------^Elapse^ displays a string with the name of the operation, if specified, and the time elapsed between start_time and current time.Options- -------name_of_operation is a user-defined string.Remarks- -------^Elapse^ automates the procedure of timing a piece of code or an entire program.  It is accurate over midnight, but not over several days.  It also creates a global S_elap, which is a numerical macro of the form hhmmss, where hh is the number of hours, mm the number of minutes, and ss the number of seconds.Examples- --------	^local st = "$S_TIME"^	^...^	^local oper "Maximum likelihood estimation"^	^elapse "`st'" "`oper'"^	- Maximum likelihood estimation took 7 minutes, 15 seconds.	^elapse `st'^	- Elapsed time was 1 hour, 10 minutes, 32 seconds.	^quietly elapse `st'^	^if $S_elap > 4500 { mat xx = startxx }^Saved Results- -------------S_elap (see above).Author- ------	Frederic Zimmerman	Food Research Institute	Stanford University
