The ^nograph^ options is forced and ^generage^ is substituted    within ^kdmany^. See help @kdensity@.^graph_options^ are (almost) arbitrary options of ^graph^; ^symbol^ and     ^connect^ options are overridden. See help @graph@.Examples- -------- . ^kdmany pension wage chldben^ . ^kdmany pension wage chldben if totincm<10000^ . ^kdmany pension wage chldben, xline(200 400)^ . ^kdmany pension wage chldben, log xline(200 400)^Also see- -------- Manual: ^[R] kdensity^On-line: help for @kdensity@, @mdensity@ (if installed)
