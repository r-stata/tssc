Alternatively, the {cmd:if} qualifier may be used to specify a single time series in a panel.{p 4 4}{it:varname} may contain time-series operators; {cmd:help varlist}.{p_end}{title:Description}{p 4 4}{cmd:lomodrs} performs Lo's (1991) modified rescaled range (R/S, "range over standard deviation") test for long range dependence of a time series. The classical R/S test, devised by Hurst (1951) and Mandelbrot (1972),is shown to be excessively sensitive to "short-range dependence" (e.g.ARMA components). Lo's modified version of the statistic takes accountof short-range dependence by performing a Newey-West correction (using a Bartlett window) to derive a consistent estimate of the long-range variance of the timeseries.{p_end}{p 4 4}Inference from the modified R/S test for long range dependenceis complementary to that derived from that of other tests for long memory,or fractional integration in a timeseries, such as {cmd:kpss}, {cmd:gphudak}, {cmd:modlpr} and {cmd:roblpr}. {p_end}{p 4 4}The maximum lag order for the test is by default calculated from the samplesize and the first-order autocorrelation coefficient of the {it:varname} using the data-dependent rule of Andrews (1991), assuming that the dgp isAR(1). The maximum lag order may be specified with the {it:maxlag} option.If it is set to zero, the test performed is the classical Hurst-Mandelbrot rescaled-range statistic. {p_end}{p 4 4}Critical values for the test are taken from Lo, 1991, Table II.{p_end}{p 4 4}The test statistic and number of observations are placed in the return array.{p_end}{title:Options}{p 4 4}{cmdab:maxlag(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the maximum lag order to be used in calculating the test. If omitted, the maximum lag order is calculated as described above.{p_end}{title:Examples}{p 4 8}{stata "use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/Mills2d/sp500a.dta":. use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/Mills2d/sp500a.dta}{p_end}{p 4 8}{stata "lomodrs sp500ar":. lomodrs sp500ar}{p_end}	{p 4 8}{stata "lomodrs sp500ar, max(0)":. lomodrs sp500ar, max(0)}{p_end}	{p 4 8}{stata "lomodrs sp500ar if tin(1946,)":. lomodrs sp500ar if tin(1946,)}{p_end}{title:Authors}{p 4 4}Christopher F.
