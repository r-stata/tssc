The simulated probabilities are fed into the likelihood function which is then maximized using traditional techniques. See Greene (2000, pp 184-185) for a description of the simulation algorithm used here.{p} {cmd:triprobit} performs a likelihood-ratio test of no correlation between the equations.{p} {hi:Warning}: due to the estimation technique, convergence can be {hi:very} slow in large samples (and/or with a large number of draws){title:Options}{p 0 4}{cmd:robust} specifies that the Huber/White/sandwich estimator ofvariance is to be used in place of the traditional calculation; see{hi:[U] 23.11 Obtaining robust variance estimates}.  {cmd:robust} combinedwith {cmd:cluster()} allows observations which are not independent withincluster (although they must be independent between clusters).  If you specify{help pweight}s, {cmd:robust} is implied.{p 0 4}{cmd:cluster(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} specifies that the observations areindependent across groups (clusters) but not necessarily within groups.{it:varname} specifies to which group each observation belongs; e.g.,{cmd:cluster(personid)} in data with repeated observations on individuals.  See{hi:[U] 23.11 Obtaining robust variance estimates}.  {cmd:cluster()} can beused with {help pweight}s to produce estimates for unstratifiedcluster-sampled data.  Specifying {cmd:cluster()} implies {cmd:robust}.{p 0 4}{cmd:draws} specifies the number of draws to be used in the simulation process. Default is 25, which is usually considered as a reasonable number of draws to make.{p 0 4}{cmd:seed} specifies the seed to be set in the simulation process, default is 123456789{p 0 4}{cmd:noinit} prevents that parameters values from three independant probits are specified as starting values for the estimation process. {p 0 4}{it: maximize_options} control the maximization process; see help {help maximize}.{title:Saved results}{p 0 4}In addition to the results saved by {cmd:maximize} (see {hi:[R] maximize}), {cmd:triprobit} also saves the following results.   {p 0 4}{hi:e(ll_c)} stores the likelihood value of the comparison model{p 0 4}{hi:e(chi2_c)} stores the chi2 statistic of the LR test against the comparison model{p 0 4}{hi:e(rho12)} stores the estimated correlation coefficient between equation 1 and equation 2{p 0 4}{hi:e(rho12_se)} stores the estimated standard-error of the correlation coefficient between equation 1 and equation 2{p 0 4}{hi:e(rho13)} stores the estimated correlation coefficient between equation 1 and equation 3{p 0 4}{hi:e(rho13_se)} stores the estimated standard-error of the correlation coefficient between equation 1 and equation 3{p 0 4}{hi:e(rho23)} stores the estimated correlation coefficient between equation 2 and equation 3{p 0 4}{hi:e(rho23_se)} stores the estimated standard-error of the correlation coefficient between equation 2 and equation 3{p 0 4}{hi:e(draws)} stores the number of draws used in the simulation{p 0 4}{hi:e(seed)} stores the seed which is set for the simulation{p 0 4}{hi:e(depvar)} stores the names of the dependat variables {p 0 4}{hi:e(cmd)} stores the command name (i.e: {it:triprobit}){title:Note}{p 0 4} rho12 represents the correlation coefficient between equation 1 and equation 2{p 0 4} rho13 represents the correlation coefficient between equation 1 and equation 3{p 0 4} rho23 represents the correlation coefficient between equation 2 and equation 3{title:Examples}{p 8 12}{inp:. triprobit (y1 = x1 x2 x3) (y2 = z1 z2 z3) (y3 = v1 v2 v3), draws(30) }{title:Also see}{p 0 19}On-line:  help for {help biprobit} {help probit}{p_end}{title:References}{p 0 19}Greene, W.H.
