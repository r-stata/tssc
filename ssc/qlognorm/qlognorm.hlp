Other times there is interest in whether thelogarithm of a variable is more nearly normal than that variable itself. Theseare two sides of the same question.  {cmd:qlognorm} and {cmd:plognorm} arecommands for investigating it directly.  {p}With official Stata, it is easy to {cmd:generate} a new variable which isthe logarithm of a variable and then to use {cmd:qnorm} and {cmd:pnorm} to seewhether that new variable is close to normal in distribution. Using{cmd:qlognorm} and {cmd:plognorm} instead has these small but distinctadvantages:  {p 4 4}1. If you do this frequently, you will need to type less; sometimes, but not always, you will decide that a log transformationis advisable. {p 4 4}2. Fit can be assessed graphically on both raw and transformed scales. {p 4 4}3. If desired, you can use a plotting position other than the i / (N + 1) wired into {cmd:qnorm} and {cmd:pnorm}. {p 4 4}4. If desired, you can insist on maximum likelihood estimation. {title:Options} {p 0 4}{cmd:grid} adds grid lines at the .05, .10, .25, .50, .75, .90, and .95quantiles when specified with {cmd:qlognorm}. It is equivalent to{cmd:yline(.25 .5 .75) xline(.25 .5 .75)} when specified with {cmd:plognorm}.{p 0 4}{it:graph_options} are any of the options allowed with {cmd:graph, twoway}; see help {help grtwoway}.{p 0 4}{cmd:a(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies a family of plotting positions, defined by{bind:(i - a)}{bind: / (N - 2a + 1)}, where i is the rank assigned to anobserved value and N is the number of observed values. The default is 0.5.(Note that the default for {cmd:qnorm} and {cmd:pnorm} is 0. Choice of {cmd:a} is rarely material unless the sample size is very small, andthen the exercise is moot whatever is done. For more on plotting positions, see{browse "http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/stat/pcrank.html":http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/stat/pcrank.html}.{p 0 4}{cmd:ml} specifies maximum likelihood estimation. This option is forpurists only. The only difference it makes is to ensure that the standarddeviation of log({it:varname}) is calculated as the root mean square deviationfrom the mean. Multiplying the default standard deviation, which is that produced by {cmd:summarize}, by a factor of {bind:sqrt(N / (N - 1))} is rarely material unless the sample size is very small, and then the exercise is moot whatever is done.{title:Examples} {p 4 8}{inp:. qnorm mpg}{p 4 8}{inp:. qlognorm mpg}{p_end} {p 4 8}{inp:. qlognorm mpg, xlog ylog}{p 4 8}{inp:. plognorm mpg}{title:Author}	Nicholas J.
