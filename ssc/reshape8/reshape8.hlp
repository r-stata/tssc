Hence, taking a dataset from long to wide and back tolong will result in getting the same dataset labelling back again.When going from wide to long, there are some labels which are notdefined; if they are then defined and the dataset is reshapedmultiple times, they will be persistent.Aside from the command name, its usage is otherwise identical to{cmd:reshape}, so see {help reshape} for syntax information.{p_end}{title:Notes}{p}{cmd:reshape8} runs only under Stata 8 and above.{p_end}{title:Author}Bill Rising email: {browse "mailto:brising@louisville.edu":brising@louisville.edu} web: {browse "http://www.louisville.edu/~wrrisi01":http://www.louisville.edu/~wrrisi01}{title:Last Updated}: December 19, 2003 @ 16:09:32
