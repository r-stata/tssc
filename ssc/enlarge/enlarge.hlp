It does not tolerateseveral observations within a group, however (though it does not checkwhether they coincide, either).Extensions to string variable and multiple non-missing observations canbe done upon request. I am not interested at the moment :). Options -------^by^ specifies the identifiers of the group to extend the value to.        This is a required option! Examples --------Suppose we have a panel data set on several countries, but area is reportedonly once for each country. . ^enlarge area, by(country)^We suppose that area of the country does not change during the period ofobservation. I.e. the data set should not go back to the 18th century :). Author ------Stas Kolenikov, skolenik@@[ recep.glasnet.ru | nes.cemi.rssi.ru | yahoo.com ]
