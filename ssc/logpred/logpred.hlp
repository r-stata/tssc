Default prints probabilities and confidence intervals; model   estimates and graph can be shown. Optionally a quadratic or a quadratic and   cubic term can be added to the model. An interaction between X and a nominal   variable can be estimated and graphed. Dummy variables are created for the   nominal variable with the lowest category defaulting to the reference group. Variables and options required------------------------------    yvar -- dependent variable  (dichotomous  0,1)    xvar -- continuous independent variable (interval or ordinal)    ^f^rom^(^#^)^ -- bottom value for xvar    ^t^o^(^#^)^ -- top value for xvar    ^i^nc^(^#^)^ -- increment size between bottom and top values (defaults to 1)        Options allowed ---------------    ^cl^ass^(^classvar^)^ -- nominal variable for a xvar by classvar interaction    ^p^oly^(^2 or 3^)^ -- polynomial terms added: 2=quadratic 3=quadratic and cubic                       (will not work with the class option)    ^adj^ust^(^covlist^)^ -- any covariates (if none specified, unadjusted                       probabilities reported); Covariates set to their mean,                       based on observations used in the analysis, or can be                       set to user specified values (e.g., age=50 gender=1)    ^m^odel -- displays the logistic regression table      ^gr^aph -- displays graph of probabilities and 95% confidence intervals; if             class is requested, confidence intervals are not displayed    ^nol^ist -- does not print list of probabilites and 95% CIs    ^l^evel^(^#^)^ -- specifies the confidence level, in percent, for calculation                    of confidence intervals (default=95%)    Examples-------- . ^logpred died age, from(20) to(80) inc(5) adj(sys hra) model^        Calculates the probability of dying for 5 year increments of age        from 20 years to 80 years (i.e., age=20,25,30,...,80) adjusted        for systolic blood pressure and heart rate; displays model and	probabilites but does not display graph . ^logpred died sys, f(60) t(300) i(20) adj(age hra) graph ylab xlab^        Calculates the probability of dying for systolic blood pressure        readings from 60 to 300 in 20 mm/hg increments, adjusted for age        and heart rate; displays graph and list of probabilites . ^logpred died sys, f(60) t(300) i(20) adj(age hra) class(race) graph^        Calculates the probability of dying for systolic blood pressure        readings from 60 to 300 in 20 mm/hg increments, adjusted for age        and heart rate, by categories of race; displays a likelihood ratio        test for interaction; graphs the results . ^logpred died age, f(40) t(80) poly(3) adj(sys=180) graph xlab ylab nolist^	Calculates the probability of dying for 1 year increments of age;	terms for age-squared and age-cubed included in model using the        poly(3) option; also adjusted for systolic blood pressure of 180;        displays graph; does not list probabilities and CIs
