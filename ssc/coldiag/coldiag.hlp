These proceduresexamine the "conditioning" of the matrix of independent variables.Coldiag first computes the condition number of the matrix.  If thisnumber is "large" (Belsley et al suggest 30 or higher), then there may be collinearity problems.  The condition number is the largest singular value. Coldiag with the FULL option list all the singular values.  All "large" singular maybe worth investigatingColdiag with the FULL option also provides further information that may help to identify the source of these problems the variance decomposition portions associated with each singular value.  If a large singular valueis associated two or more variables with "large" variance decompositionportions,  these variables may be causing collinearity problems.  Belsleyet al suggest that a "large" portion is 50 percent or more.Syntax------^coldiag^ [varlist] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] ^[, Full NOScale]Options-------^full^ produces the full variance decomposition matrix.  By default,coldiag only generates the condition number.^noscale^ does not scale each column vector to unit length.

Examination of the variancedecomposition portion shows that portions associated with length (.988)and weight (.429) are fairly high.  In addition, the singular values of 41.77 and 58.60 are high.  Associatedwith the former are the fairly large decomposition portions of .47 fordispl and .628 for gratio.In this case, coldiag does not provide any insight that a simple correlationwould not.  The correlation between weight and length is .95, and betweendispl and gratio it is -.83.  Reference---------D. Belsley, E. Kuh, and R. Welsch (1980).  Regression Diagnositics.Wiley.
