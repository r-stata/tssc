.-help for ^muxyplot^.-Scatter plots with multiple x and y variables---------------------------------------------    ^muxyplot^ yvars xvars [weight] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]    [ ^,^ graph_options ^l^ink ^n^eed^(^string^)^ ]Description-----------^muxyplot^ produces a scatter or twoway plot for yvars versus xvars,all of which xvars are measured on comparable scales. The number ofyvars must equal the number of xvars. For example,^muxyplot^ y1 y2 y3 x1 x2 x3plots y1 versus x1, y2 versus x2 and y3 versus x3, all on the samescatter plot.Options-------graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^. ^connect^ and^symbol^ refer to the y-axis variables. Note that    1. ^connect(||)^ and ^connect(II)^ are either unusable or    irrelevant.    2. ^sy([_n])^ does not work properly. Instead do something like    ^gen id = _n^    ^muxyplot^ ... ^, sy(...[id]...) need(id)^    3. As exemplified above, any variables named in options should also    be specified in the ^need^ option.^link^ connects each sequence of data points for each observation    (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ... by a segmented straight line. For    example, if each pair of variables refers to a specific time, then    the trajectory of an individual over time may be shown in this way.    ^link^ may not be combined with ^connect()^.^need(^string^)^ specifies variables needed by options and not mentioned    before the options. (Otherwise, those variables would be lost by the    ^stack^ included in ^muxyplot^.) Two or more variable names should    be separated by spaces.Limitation----------^by( ) link total^ is allowed as a combination of  options but is notguaranteed to produce a correct ^total^ graph, because sorting first onthe ^by( )^ variable may have the side-effect of producing spuriousconnections between data points.Examples-------- . ^muxyplot wrunoff srunoff wrain17 srain17, c(ss) bands(7)^ . ^muxyplot br60 br70 br80 br90 dr60 dr70 dr80 dr90, link^ . ^regress y1 x1^ . ^predict y1p^ . ^regress y2 x2^  . ^predict y2p^  . ^muxyplot y1 y1p y2 y2p x1 x1 x2 x2, c(.l.l) sy(oipi) sort^    ^l2(y1 and y2) b2(x1 and x2)^ Author------         Nicholas J.
