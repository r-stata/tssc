This is usefulwhen row and column equations contain spaces or even single quotes, as sometimes happens with equation namesfor {help estimates:matrix estimation results} generated by {help mlogit} when the multinomialoutcome variable has value labels.The returned lists can then be assigned to other matrices using the {help matrname:matrix roweq},{help matrname:matrix coleq}, {help matrname:matrix rownames} and {help matrname:matrix colnames}commands.{title:Options}{p 0 4}{cmd:noisily} specifies that the lists will be echoed to the Stata log.{title:Remarks}{p}{cmd:qrowname} and {cmd:qcolname} will not fail if row and column names and/or equation namescontain spaces and/or single quotes. Unfortunately, they will fail if a name contains an unpairedright double quote. Fortunately, this does not often happen in Stata, although it can be made tohappen, by creating a string variable whose values contain unpaired right double quotes and thenusing {help encode} to encode it to a numeric variable, which is then used as a multinomial outcomeby {help mlogit}.{title:Examples}{p 16 20}{inp:. qrowname mickey}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. matrix roweq matti=`r(eq)'}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. matr def vera=e(V)}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. qcolname vera,noi}{p_end}{title:Author}{p}Roger Newson, King's College, London, UK.Email: {browse "mailto:roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk":roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk}{title:Also see}{p 0 10}{bind: }Manual:   {hi:[P] matrix rownames}, {hi: [P] matrix define}, {hi:[P] macro}{p_end}{p 0 10}On-line:   help for {help matrname}, {help matrix}, {help macro}, {help mlogit}{p_end}
