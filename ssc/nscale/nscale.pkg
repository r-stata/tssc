d 'NSCALE': module to scale data
d
d   nscale provides a convenient way to recode variables to lie
d between 0 and 1 via dividing var-min(var) by max(var)-min(var).
d nscale can recode many variables at once and has options gen()
d and pre() which work in the similar manner as Stataâ€™s default
d command recode does. It is also possible to store transformed
d values in existing variables with option nopost. nscale can set
"d specific value or interval to missing (.) as well. For example,"
d if a survey question q1 coded DK as 98 and miscellaneous as 99
"d and you want to exclude those values from analysis, just type:"
"d nscale q1 , m(98) up. Then nscale sets all observations whose"
d value is greater than or equal to 98 to missing (.). The option
"d down combined with option m(#) works similarly. Moreover, nscale"
d does reverse coding with option r and tabulates new variables
d with option t.
