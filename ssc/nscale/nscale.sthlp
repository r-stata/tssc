{title:Description}

{pstd}
	{cmd:nscale} provides a convenient way to {cmd:recode} variables in {varlist}
	to lie between 0 and 1 via dividing {it:var}-{opt min(var)} by {opt max(var)}-{opt min(var)}.
	{cmd:nscale} can {cmd:recode} many variables at once and has options {opth generate(namelist)} and {opth prefix(name)}
	which work in the similar manner as Stataâ€™s default command {cmd:recode} does.
	It is also possible to store transformed values in existing variables with option {opt nopostfix}.

{pstd}
	{cmd:nscale} can set specific value or interval to missing (.) as well. For example,
	if a survey question q1 coded {it:DK} as {it:98} and {it:miscellaneous} as {it:99}
	and you want to exclude those values from analysis, just type: {cmd:nscale q1} , {opt m(98)} {opt up}.
	Then {cmd:nscale} sets all observations whose value is greater than or equal to {it:98} to missing (.).
	The option {opt down} combined with option {opth missing(#)} works similarly.

{pstd}
	Moreover, {cmd:nscale} does reverse coding with option {opt reverse} and tabulates new variables with option {opt tab}.
