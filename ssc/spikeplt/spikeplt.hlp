The frequency of each value, after any rounding,and applying any weight, is shown by a vertical spike drawn from areference level (by default 0).If used to produce histograms, the default is to show raw frequencies ineach bin or interval. In contrast to ^graph, histogram^, there is norestriction to a maximum of 50 bins, and a few hundred spikes may betolerable, especially if there are interesting gaps, clusters orpreferred values. Berry (1996, p.14) uses the name `spike chart' forthis kind of histogram.If used to produce time series plots, the varname would be the timevariable, and the weight variable would be the values for those times.Chapman and Mahon (1986, p.84) used the name `spike graph' for such aplot.Options-------^round(^#^)^ uses the round( ) function to round varname to the nearest    multiple of #. See help on @functions@. In other words, round    specifies the binwidth.    With ^round(1)^ values between 0.5 and 1.5 would be rounded to 1 and    the bin frequency shown as a spike at 1.^shift^ shifts bins so that the bin boundaries, rather than the bin    centres, are multiples of #.    With ^round(1) shift^ values between 1 and 2 would be rounded to 1.5    and the bin frequency shown as a spike at 1.5.^frac^ specifies that the vertical scale is to show fractions.  Note    that this convention is the opposite of that for ^graph, histogram^.^root^ specifies that the vertical scale is to show square roots of    frequencies (J.W. Tukey's `rootogram'). See Tukey (1972, 1977) or    Velleman and Hoaglin (1981).^zero(^#^)^ specifies a constant other than 0 as a level from which    spikes are drawn vertically.graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^. ^by^ is allowed,    but ^total^ is trapped with a warning, as the total graph produced    with ^by(^byvar^)^ ^total^ would superimpose spikes, not add them    vertically.The defaults for graph_options are    ^l2title^ of "Frequency" (or "Fraction", if ^frac^ is    used, or "Root of frequency", if ^root^ is used)    ^b2title^ of the variable label of varname (or varname itself, if    that is not defined)    ^c(||)^, so that each bin or value is shown by a vertical spike    ^sy(ii)^Examples--------        . ^spikeplt wallasp, round(5)^        . ^spikeplt day [w=rain] if rain, l2("Daily rainfall in mm") gap(5)^        ^xla yla^        . ^spikeplt age [w=pop], l2("Population in 000") gap(5) yla^        ^xla(0,20,40,60,80) xti(10,30,50,70,90)^References----------Berry, D.A. 1996.
