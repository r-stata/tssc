The eigenvalues of a square symmetric matrix may be calculated by {help mat symeigen}, but official Statacannot calculate the eigenvalues of a nonsymmetric matrix. {cmd:geneigen} executes EISPACK code to calculate the eigenvalues' real part, imaginary part, and modulus via the QR algorithm for real Hessenberg matrices, as described in Press et al. (1992,Chapter 11). {p}The routine returns a {cmd:N} by 4 matrix {cmd:r(eigen)}, containing, respectively, the modulus, real part, imaginary part, and cumulated modulus. The eigenvalues are sorted in order of ascending moduli. {p} If Stata considers a matrix to be symmetric, its own {help mat symeigen} routine shouldbe used rather than this routine.{title:Examples}{p 8 12}{inp:. mat kk=(1,2,3\-6,-8,-14\122,345,678)}{p 8 12}{inp:. geneigen kk}{p 8 12}{inp:. return list}{title:Acknowledgements}The routine makes use of Jeroen Weesie's {cmd:qsortidx} routine, part of his veryuseful {stata findit qsort:qsort} package.
