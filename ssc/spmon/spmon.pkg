d 'SPMON': module to create spatial effect variable for monadic data
d
d  spmon generates a spatial effect variable for analysis of
"d spatial dependence in monadic data, i.e. where the estimation"
d dataset consists of individual units (as in the vast majority of
"d datasets used in the social sciences), rather than of dyads"
d (pairs of units). It can create spatial effect variables for
"d spatial lag, spatial-x and spatial error models."
