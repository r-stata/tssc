{pstd}{cmd:xtcsi} {hline 2} Investigating Residual Cross-Section Independence
{p2colreset}{...}


{title:Syntax}

{pstd}{cmd:xtcsi} {depvar} {indepvars} {ifin} [{cmd:,} {cmd:trend} ]


{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:xtcsi} implements in balanced panel time-series data, error test for cross-section independence: i) the Breusch and Pagan (1980) LM test; 
ii) the Pesaran, Ullah and Yamagata (2008) bias-adjusted LM test; iii) the Pesaran (2004) CD test.

The null hypothesis is:

H0: Cov(uit,ujt) = 0 for all t and i!=j

{p 4 4 2}{cmdab:Background:}

{p 4 4 2}Cross-section dependence in macro panel data has received a lot of attention in the emerging panel 
time series literature over the past decade (for an introduction to panel time series see Eberhardt, 2009). 
This type of correlation may arise from globally common shocks with heterogeneous impact across countries, 
such as the oil crises in the 1970s or the global financial
crisis from 2007 onwards. Alternatively it can be the result of local spillover effects between countries or 
regions. For a detailed discussion of the topic within cross-country empirics see Eberhardt and Teal (2011). 
For a survey and application of existing cross-section dependence tests refer to Moscone and Tosetti (2009).


{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:trend} specifies a group-specific linear trend to be included in the regression model.
