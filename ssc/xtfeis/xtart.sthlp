{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:xtart} implements the ART version of the Hausman test.
{cmd:xtart} is used after estimation of a linear Fixed-Effects models with Individual-Specific Slopes (FEIS) (Wooldridge 2010, pp. 374-381). 
It tests the Null hypothesis that there are no systematic differences in coefficients between an FEIS and a standard FE model. 
The ART is intended as a test for inconsistency of FE estimates due to heterogeneous slopes of a subset of covariates. 
{cmd:xtart} can also be used to test for differences between standard FE and standard Random-Effects (RE) estimates, a typical application of the ART version of the Hausman test (Arellano 1993), 
and to test for differences between FEIS and RE estimates.

{pstd}
{cmd:xtart} requires estimation of a regression model using {cmd:xtfeis} before the ART test is conducted. 
You may specify the name of {it:Model A} after saving regression results with {cmd:estimates store} (see [XT] estimates). 
If {it:Model A} is not specified, {cmd:xtart} uses regression results of the most recent model estimated by {cmd:xtfeis}. The ART tests for
systematic differences in coefficients between {it:Model A} and a restricted {it:Model B}.

{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Options}

{phang}
{opt fe} requests the ART for comparing coefficients of standard FE and RE models.
By default, coefficients of an FEIS and an FE model are compared. 

{phang}
{opt re} requests the ART for comparing coefficients of an FEIS and an RE model.
By default, coefficients of an FEIS and an FE model are compared. 

{phang}
{opt addvars(varlist)} adds further covariates in varlist to the specification of {it:Model B}.

{phang}
{opt keep(varlist)} requests that the ART be conducted only for the specified subset of common coefficients of {it:Model A} and {it:Model B}.

{phang}
{opt predicted(stub1 stub2)} adds variables to the data set carrying unit-specific means
and predicted values for the dependent variable and covariates of {it:Model A}. 
Names of the variables carrying predicted values are original variable names prefixed by {it:stub1}. 
Variable names for the means are prefixed by {it:stub2}. If {it:stub1} and {it:stub2} are left unspecified, 
default prefixes {it:pred} and {it:mean} are used.
