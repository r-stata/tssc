Calculating centroids---------------------centroid ^varlist^ if ^exp^ in ^exp^ [weight], group(^groupvar^) [dist(#)]The program ^centroid^ takes as input a set of variables and a grouping variable, which is designated ^groupvar^.  ^Groupvar^ indicates into which group each case falls.  As output, it generates a set of group ^centroids^,which are means of each variable in ^varlist^, and a set of distances, whichindicate how far each case is from each centroid.Output is as follows:Let g be the number of levels of ^groupvar^.Let v be the number of variables in ^varlist^.CENTij, for i=1,...,g;j=1,...,v: 		The mean of the ith group on the jth variable. DISTi, for i=1,...g:		The distance of each case from the ith centroid.Distance option---------------"Distance" is calculated by the Minkowski metric with parameter specifiedby the dist(#) option.  If you do not specify this option, Euclidean distanceis assumed (#=2).  Allowable values are greater than or equal to 1.Author's contact information is in the ado file.
