Probability plot for data compared with fitted exponential distribution
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ^pexp5^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [ ^, m^ean^(^#^) gr^id
    graph_options ]

Description
-----------

^pexp5^ produces a probability plot for varname compared with a
one-parameter exponential distribution, with distribution function
1 - exp(-varname / mean). The values of varname should be zero or
positive.

Note: this is the original version of ^pexp^, written for Stata 5. 
Users of Stata 8 up should switch to ^pexp^. 


Options
-------

^mean(^#^)^ specifies that the mean of the fitted distribution is to
    be #. If ^mean()^ is not specified the mean of the data set is
    used.

^grid^ is equivalent to ^yline(.25,.5,.75) xline(.25,.5,.75)^.

graph_options are any of the options allowed with ^graph, twoway^; see
    help for ^graph^.


Example
-------

        . ^pexp5 precip^
