Euclidian distance is used as default.The followingmeasures are allowed:	^co^variance: covariance between observations.	^cor^relation: correlation coefficient between observations.	^ma^nhattan: Manhattan distance between observations.	^mi^nkowski^[^n^]^: Minkowski metrics of dimension ^n^. Euclidian and	Manhattan distances are particular cases of dimension 2 and 1 	respectively.^average^ calculates mean distances if Manhattan, Euclidian or Minkowskidistances are specified. This option is specially useful if missingvaluesare present in the original dataset.^sa^ve^(^filename^)^ saves the results to ^filename^Remarks- -------Saved output contains three variables: ^elem1^, ^elem2^ and ^distan^.The first twoidentify the observation numbers of the original dataset for which thedistance^distan^ was calculated.Examples- -------- . ^distan x y z, st^ . ^distan x y z, di(mi[3.2]) av sa(c:\dist.dta)^ . ^distan x y z, di(cor)^Author- ------Jose Maria Sanchez Saez
