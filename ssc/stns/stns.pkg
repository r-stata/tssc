d 'STNS': module for estimation of net survival
d
d   stns computes net survival as proposed by Pohar et al.
d (Biometrics 2012).  The command lists graphs and saves the
d estimated net survival and related   functions.   stns is
d designed to work with large data sets.   stns takes into acount
d the date of entry into the study (when enter() option is used in
"d stset)  Thus, period- and hybrid-analysis are available.    The"
d range of values in the vertical axis of the graphs can be
d restricted.
