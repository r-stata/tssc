d 'SURVEYBIAS': module to compute the B and B_w multinomial accuracy measures for polling bias
d
d   This module estimates by Maximum Likelihood methods various
d polling accuracy measures for multi-party elections based on a
"d generalisation of Martin, Traugott and Kennedy's two-party"
d predictive accuracy index A. For detailed information on the
"d measures A', B and B_w, see Arzheimer, Kai and Jocelyn Evans: A"
d New Multinomial Accuracy Measure for Polling Bias. Forthcoming in
"d Political Analysis(21) 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpt012"
d The module consists of three ados: surveybias.ado is for use with
d a single survey (raw data). surveybiasseries.ado facilitates the
d comparison of surveys. It calculates accuracy measures from a
"d dataset, where each row contains margins from a single survey."
d surveybiasi.ado is an immediate command that makes it easy to
d calculate accuracy measures from published survey results.  Two
d example data sets illustrate the use of surveybias and
d surveybiasseries. More replication data and scripts are available
