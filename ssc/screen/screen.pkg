"d 'SCREEN': module to quickly identify possible outliers based on the interquartile range, percentile or standard deviation"
d
d   screen quickly identifies possible outliers based on the
"d interquartile range, percentile or standard deviation. For"
"d example, screen can identify Tukeyâ€™s severe outliers (more than"
d 3 IQR away from the nearer quartile) and mild outliers (between
"d 1.5 and 3 IQR away from the nearer quartile), Gaussian outliers"
d based on the three-sigma-rule (more than 3 SD away from the
"d mean), Chebyshev's inequality (no more than 1/k^2 of values can"
"d be more than k standard deviations away from the mean), and"
d percentile outliers (top and bottom sample trimming).
