The first two variablesgive the row and column indices of the covariance, provided in the third variable, while {cmd:pw_N} provides the number of observations used to compute thatcovariance. These variables are added to the current data set, and must not alreadyexist.{title:Examples}{p 4 8 2}{stata "webuse grunfeld" :. webuse grunfeld}{p_end} {p 4 8 2}{stata "reshape wide invest mvalue kstock time , i(year) j(company)" :. reshape wide invest mvalue kstock time , i(year) j(company)}{p 4 8 2}{stata "pwcov invest1 invest2 invest3 invest4 invest5, print save" :. pwcov invest1 invest2 invest3 invest4 invest5, print save}{title:Author}{p 4 4 2}Christopher F.
