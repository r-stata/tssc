The columnsto be displayed can be controlled by the userand extra options to show the number of observations or likelihood ratio P-valueassociated with eachcovariate is provided. The command is particularly suited to regressionoutput containing dummy variables and interaction terms created by {help xi}.{p}The reformatted output may also be copied into a spreadsheet or word-processor to create near-publicationquality tables. The best way to do this is using the {hi:delimit()}. Thencopy and paste the output into a word processor and use a `converttext to table' option in your word processor.{p}By default all terms fitted in the regression model are re-displayed,although this can be restricted by specifying {it:varlist}. Auxillary parameters,such as the second constant from {help nbreg} or the cut points from {help ologit},are omitted.{p}{hi:reformat} responds to two new variable characteristics (see {help char}): [units] and [mult]. The {hi:units}characteristic is used to describe the measurement units of continuous variables such as:{p 8 12}{inp:. char age[units] years}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. char sbp[units] mmHg}{p}The {hi:mult} characteristic determines the unit multiplier for reporting the effect sizeof a continuous variable. For instance:{p 8 12}{inp:. char age[mult] 10}{p_end}{p}would request effects for age to be reported per decade.{title:Options}{p 0 4}{cmd:output(}{it:options}{cmd:)} describes the columns to be displayed where {it:options} isone or more of:{p 8 10}{cmd:e} {space 3} estimated coefficient{p_end}{p 8 10}{cmd:s} {space 3} standard error{p_end}{p 8 10}{cmd:z} {space 3} Z-value (or t-value if appropriate){p_end}{p 8 10}{cmd:p} {space 3} P-value{p_end}{p 8 10}{cmd:c} {space 3} confidence interval{p_end}{p 8 10}{cmd:n} {space 3} number of observations{p_end}{p 4 4}Columns will be displayed in the order you specify.{p 0 4}{cmd:cw(}{it:#}{cmd:)} is the coefficient width. This is the number of charactersallocated to describing the coefficients (22 by default). You may need to increase thisvalue if you have attached long value labels to variables that appear in the model.{p 0 4}{cmd:nocons} suppresses the constant term ({help _cons}).{p 0 4}{cmd:lrtest} replaces the usual Z-test P-values with likelihood ratiotest P-values for each term (or group of related {hi:xi} terms in the case of categoricalvariables) in the model. Note this optionmay take some time to process while the various models are beingfitted. {cmd:noisily} displays the raw results of the likelihood ratiotests as they are produced.{p 0 4}{cmd:eform} reports the coefficients in exponentiated form. Useful after{help logit} to show odds ratios and {help poisson} to show incidence rate ratios.{p 0 4}{cmd:sd} and {cmd:iqr} report regression coefficients for continuous variablesper standard deviation or interquartile range respectively. Usefulwhen the variable has a large range of values so that the regressioncoefficient per unit is very small. These options have no effect on variablesthat have their [mult] characteristic set.{p 0 4}{cmd:dpcoef(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the number of decimal places (3 by default) touse when reporting the coefficients, standard errors and CIs.{p 0 4}{cmd:dpp(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the number of decimal places (3 by default) touse when reporting the z values and p-values.{p 0 4}{cmd:nfmt(%}{it:fmt}{cmd:)} alters the formatting applied to the number ofobservations. In particular the comma format {hi:%7.0fc} might be of interest.{p 0 4}{cmd:nobrackets} suppresses the brackets placed around the CI estimates.{p 0 4}{cmd:to(}{it:string}{cmd:)} specifies the text to use between the lower CI and upperCI ("to" by default). Use {hi:no} to suppress this text completely.{p 0 4}{cmd:delimit(}{it:string}{cmd:)} causes the output to be presented with the specified{it:string} between the columns instead of spacing. Useful when the outputis to be copied into a word-processor and converted into a table.{p 0 4}{cmd:sort} re-arranges the variable list into ascending alphabetical order.Useful after stepwise regression or when the same baseline variableis involved in more than one interaction. In these situations thevariable list can become scrambled leading to unclear output.{p 0 4}{cmd:prefix(}{it:string}{cmd:)} should be used if you used the {hi:prefix()} optionin your {help xi} command. By default {hi:reformat} assumes your categorical variablesare prefixed with _I or I (dependent on Stata version).{title:Examples}{p 8 12}{inp:. reformat}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. reformat, output(necp) nfmt(%7.0fc) lrtest}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. reformat, eform to(-) delim(;) dpcoef(2) dpp(2)}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. xi, prefix(_S): logistic resp i.gender i.ihd age fev1}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. reformat, prefix(_S)}{p_end}{title:Author}{p 8 12}Tony Brady, {browse "http://www.sealedenvelope.com/":Sealed Envelope Ltd}, U.K.{p_end}{p 8 12}{browse "mailto:tony@sealedenvelope.com?subject=reformat.ado":tony@sealedenvelope.com}{title:Also see}{p 1 14}Manual:  {hi:[U] 26 Estimation and post-estimation commands},{p_end}{p 10 14}{hi:[R] xi}{p 0 19}On-line:  help for {help fit}, {help xi}, {help lrtest}, {help char}
