.-help for ^fulltab^ .-syntax------- ^fulltab^ varlist [if] [in] , ^V^als^(^# [ # [...]]^)^ ^M^at(matname) ^MISS^ingdescription------------Suppose you want to tabulate a set of variables, say v1 to v15, each of whichcan take on the same possible values (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5) and stack the resulting frequencies into a matrix using the ^matcell^ option of @tabulate@.A problem appears when one value, say "5", has count 0 (i.e. never appearsin a specific variable, say v12. Then the resulting matrix produced by matcell hasonly 4 elements, while the other vectors have 5. And trying to append a rowof the wrong length to a matrix will cause an error.^fulltab^ obviates this problem by temporarily adding observations to yourdata set, one for each possible value in your list, thus generating full tables.The counts are all off by one and are corrected before exit. And addedobservations are dropped.Options--------^vals(...)^ is required. It provides the values to be counted.^mat(.)^ is required. It provides the matrix name.^missing^ is optional. If present counts will be performed on observationswhich contain no missing vallues on any of the variables in ^varlist^.Author -------      Guy D. van Melle       University of Lausanne, Switzerland      guy.van-melle@@inst.hospvd.chAlso see---------  @ tabulate@, @matrix@
