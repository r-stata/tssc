{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:adjacent} lists adjacent values for a set of numeric
variables in {it:varlist}. Calculate the upper and lower quartiles, p75 and
p25, and thus the interquartile range iqr = p75 - p25. Then the adjacent 
values are the highest value not greater than p75 + 3/2 iqr and the lowest
value not less than p25 - 3/2 iqr. The adjacent values are marked graphically 
on a box plot as drawn by {help graph_box:graph box} or 
{help graph_box:graph hbox} by the ends of the whiskers drawn out from 
each central box. 
 

{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:by()} defines one or more grouping variables. (When using  
{help graph_box:graph box} or {help graph_box:graph hbox}, these variables
would be specified in {cmd:by()} or {cmd:over()} options.) 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:missing}, applicable only with {cmd:by()}, specifies that results
for observations with missing values of variables specified in {cmd:by()} 
should be included in the tabulation. The default is to exclude them.
