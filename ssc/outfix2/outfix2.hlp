.-help for ^outfix2^.-Outputting formatted data-------------------------    ^outfix2^ varlist [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] ^using^ filename     ^, c^ols^(^numlist^)^ [ ^f^ormat ]     Description-----------^outfix2^ lists varlist in filename. Remarks-------^outfix2^ displays data on screen and logs what it displays in a temporary file, which is then copied to a permanent file. Therefore, it may not be run ^quietly^ without suppressing its useful output. Any logging previously started will be suspended while it is operating. Options-------^cols(^numlist^)^ is a required option specifying the columns in which     the values for each variable should start. ^outfix2^ checks only that     the numbers in numlist are ascending integers. It is the user's    responsibility to check that the column specification provides enough     space for data to be shown properly. ^format^ specifies that the format of each variable should be used in     listing. The format may be used to control number of decimal places     shown and right- or left-justification. See @format@. Example-------    . ^outfix2 price weight mpg using auto.out, cols(1 11 21)^ Acknowledgement---------------	^outfix2^ takes ideas from a program ^outfix^ written by Gero 	Lipsmeier. 	 Author------         Nicholas J.
