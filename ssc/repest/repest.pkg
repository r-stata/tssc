d 'REPEST': module to run estimations with weighted replicate samples and plausible values
d
d  repest estimates statistics using replicate weights (balanced
"d repeated replication or brr weights, jackknife replicate"
"d weights,...), thus accounting for complex survey designs in the"
d estimation of sampling variances. It is specially designed to be
"d used with the PISA, PIAAC and TALIS datasets produced by the"
d OECD. It also allows for analyses with multiply imputed variables
"d (plausible values); where plausible values are used, the average"
d estimator across plausible values is reported and the imputation
d error is added to the variance estimator.
