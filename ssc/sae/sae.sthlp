    {c |} The {cmd:sae} suite of commands deals with small area estimation,{col 68}{c |}
    {c |} abbreviated as {cmd:sae} data. To become familiar with {cmd:sae}{col 68}{c |}
    {c |} as quickly as possible, do the following{col 68}{c |}

To perform data related functins such as to import the target dataset to a more manageable
format for the simulations; to export the resulting simulations to a dataset of the
user’s preference; and to compare the variables between the sources of data.

To perform first stage estimation on {cmd:sae} data. This routine is for obtaining the GLS estimates of the first stage. The
sub-routines, {bf:{help sae_model_lmm:sae model lmm}} (linear mixed model) and {bf:{help sae_model_povmap:sae model povmap}} (povmap) are used interchangeably

To perform second stage estimation on {cmd:sae} data. This routine and sub-routine obtains the GLS estimates of the first
stage, and goes on to perform the Monte Carlo simulations
