{title:Required packages}

{pstd} 
{cmd:ceqpop} requires installation of {cmd:quantiles} (Osorio, 2007); to install, {stata ssc install quantiles:ssc install quantiles}.

{title:Description}

{pstd} 
{cmd:ceqpop} divides the households in a survey into groups based on their incomes before and after 
taxes and transfers. It creates two types of group: relative and absolute. Relative groups are 
determined so that the number of individuals in the expanded sample is equivalent in each group (the 
number of individual or household observations in the survey or the number of households in the 
expanded sample are not necessary equal across groups). Relative groups include deciles (10% groups) 
and centiles (1% groups). Absolute groups are based on absolute income amounts; there are six income 
groups with default cut-offs that can be changed with the command's {opth cut1(real)} to {opth cut5(real)} 
options: ultra-poor (less than $1.25 per day in purchasing power parity [PPP] adjusted US dollars), 
extreme poor ($1.25 to $2.50 PPP per day), moderate poor ($2.50 to $4 PPP per day), vulnerable ($4 to 
$10 PPP per day), middle class ($10 to $50 PPP per day) and wealthy ($50 and more PPP per day). There 
are also fine-grained income bins, which move in $0.05 PPP per day intervals from $0 to $10, then from 
$0.25 intervals from $10 to $50. Observations with negative income values are included in the first bin.

{pstd}
Populations of each group are computed when households are ranked by each of the CEQ core income 
concepts: market income, market income plus pensions, net market income, gross income, taxable income, 
disposable income, consumable income, and final income. The variables for these income concepts, which 
should be expressed in local currency units (preferably {bf:per year} for ease of comparison with 
totals from national accounts), are indicated using the {opth m:arket(varname)}, 
{opth mp:luspensions(varname)}, {opth n:etmarket(varname)}, {opth g:ross(varname)}, 
{opth t:axable(varname)}, {opth d:isposable(varname)}, {opth c:onsumable(varname)}, 
{opth c:onsumable(varname)}, and {opth f:inal(varname)} options. 

{pstd}
{cmd: ceqpop} automatically converts local currency variables to PPP dollars, using the PPP conversion 
factor given by {opth ppp(real)}, the consumer price index (CPI) of the year of PPP (e.g., 2005 or 
2011) given by {opth cpib:ase(real)}, and the CPI of the year of the household 
survey used in the analysis given by {opth cpis:urvey(real)}. The year of PPP, also called base year, 
refers to the year of the International Comparison Program (ICP) that is being used, e.g. 2005 or 2011. 
The survey year refers to the year of the household survey used in the analysis. If the year of PPP is 
2005, the PPP conversion factor should be the "2005 PPP conversion factor, private consumption (LCU per 
international $)" indicator from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI). If the year of 
PPP is 2011, use the "PPP conversion factor, private consumption (LCU per international $)" indicator 
from WDI. The PPP conversion factor should convert from year of PPP to year of PPP. In other words, 
when extracting the PPP conversion factor, it is possible to select any year; DO NOT select the year of 
the survey, but rather the year that the ICP was conducted to compute PPP conversion factors (e.g., 
2005 or 2011). The base year (i.e., year of PPP) CPI, which can also be obtained from WDI, should match 
the base year chosen for the PPP conversion factor. The survey year CPI should match the year of the 
household survey. Finally, for the PPP conversion, the user can specify whether the original variables 
are in local currency units per day ({opt da:ily}), per month ({opt mo:nthly}), or per year 
({opt year:ly}, the default assumption).

{pstd}
If the data set is at the individual level (each observation is an individual), the variable with the 
identification code of each household (i.e., it takes the same value for all members within a 
household) should be specified in the {opth hh:id(varname)} option; the {opth hs:ize(varname)} option 
should not be specified. If the data set is at the household level, the number of members in the 
household should be specified in {opth hs:ize(varname)}; the {opth hh:id(varname)} option should not be 
specified. In either case, the weight used should be the household sampling weight and should {it:not} 
be multiplied by the number of members in the household since the program will do this multiplication 
automatically in the case of household-level data. 

{pstd}
There are two options for including information about weights and survey sample design for accurate
estimates and statistical inference. The sampling weight can be entered using  
{weight} or {help svyset}. Information about complex stratified sample designs can also be entered 
using {help svyset} since {cmd:ceqpop} automatically uses the information specified using {help svyset}. 
Alternatively, the primary sampling unit can be entered using the {opth psu(varname)} option and 
strata can be entered using the {opth s:trata(varname)} option. 

{pstd}
By default, {cmd: ceqpop} does not allow income concept or fiscal intervention variables to have missing 
values: if a household has 0 income for an income concept, receives 0 from a transfer or a subsidy, 
or pays 0 of a tax, the household should have 0 rather than a missing value. If one of these variables has 
missing values, the command will produce an error. For flexibility, however, the command includes an 
{opt ignorem:issing} option that will drop observations with missing values for any of these variables, thus 
allowing the command to run even if there are missing values. 

{pstd}
Negative incomes are allowed, but a warning is issued for each core income concept that has negative values. This 
is because various measures are no longer well-behaved when negative values are included 
(for example, the Gini coefficient, concentration coefficient, or squared poverty gap can exceed 1, and other desirable 
properties of these measures when incomes are non-negative no longer hold when negative values are allowed).

{pstd}
Results are automatically exported to the CEQ Master Workbook if 
{cmd:using} {it:filename} is specifed in the command, where {it:filename} is the Master Workbook. By 
default, {cmd:ceqpop} prints to a sheet titled "E2. Population"; the user can override the sheet name 
using the {opt sheet(string)} option. Exporting directly to the Master Workbook requires Stata 13 or 
newer. The Master Workbook populated with results from {cmd:ceqpop} can be automatically opened if the 
{opt open} option is specified (in this case, {it:filename} cannot have spaces). Results are also 
saved in matrices available from {cmd:return list}. To produce only a portion of the results, specify 
only a subset of the income concept options or use {opt nod:ecile}, {opt nog:roup}, {opt noc:entile}, 
or {opt nob:in}.
