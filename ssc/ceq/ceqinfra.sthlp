{title:Description}

{pstd} 
{cmd:ceqinfra} calculates 
the coverage and distribution of infrastructure access, for infrastructure access
variables such as electricity, drinkable water, sanitation, and roads.
Up to 8 infrastructure access variables can be used, and should be supplied 
in {varlist}.

{pstd}
For results by income group, the cut-offs of these groups 
can be changed using the {opth cut1(real)} to {opth cut5(real)} options; the default groups are 
ultra-poor (less than $1.25 per day in purchasing power parity [PPP] adjusted US dollars), extreme poor 
($1.25 to $2.50 PPP per day), moderate poor ($2.50 to $4 PPP per day), vulnerable ($4 to $10 PPP per 
day), middle class ($10 to $50 PPP per day) and wealthy ($50 and more PPP per day). For example, specify {cmd:cut1(1.90)} to 
change the first cut-off to $1.90 PPP per day (which would cause the lowest group to become less than 
$1.90 PPP per day, and the second group--if {opth cut2(real)} is not specified so the default second 
cut-off is maintained--to range from $1.90 to $2.50 PPP). 

{pstd}
{cmd: ceqinfra} automatically converts local currency variables to PPP dollars, using the PPP conversion 
factor given by {opth ppp(real)}, the consumer price index (CPI) of the year of PPP (e.g., 2005 or 
2011) given by {opth cpib:ase(real)}, and the CPI of the year of the household 
survey used in the analysis given by {opth cpis:urvey(real)}. The year of PPP, also called base year, 
refers to the year of the International Comparison Program (ICP) that is being used, e.g. 2005 or 2011. 
The survey year refers to the year of the household survey used in the analysis. If the year of PPP is 
2005, the PPP conversion factor should be the "2005 PPP conversion factor, private consumption (LCU per 
international $)" indicator from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI). If the year of 
PPP is 2011, use the "PPP conversion factor, private consumption (LCU per international $)" indicator 
from WDI. The PPP conversion factor should convert from year of PPP to year of PPP. In other words, 
when extracting the PPP conversion factor, it is possible to select any year; DO NOT select the year of 
the survey, but rather the year that the ICP was conducted to compute PPP conversion factors (e.g., 
2005 or 2011). The base year (i.e., year of PPP) CPI, which can also be obtained from WDI, should match 
the base year chosen for the PPP conversion factor. The survey year CPI should match the year of the 
household survey. Finally, for the PPP conversion, the user can specify whether the original variables 
are in local currency units per day ({opt da:ily}), per month ({opt mo:nthly}), or per year 
({opt year:ly}, the default assumption).

{pstd}
If the data set is at the individual level (each observation is an individual), the variable with the 
identification code of each household (i.e., it takes the same value for all members within a 
household) should be specified in the {opth hh:id(varname)} option; the {opth hs:ize(varname)} option 
should not be specified. If the data set is at the household level, the number of members in the 
household should be specified in {opth hs:ize(varname)}; the {opth hh:id(varname)} option should not be 
specified. In either case, the weight used should be the household sampling weight and should {it:not} 
be multiplied by the number of members in the household since the program will do this multiplication 
automatically in the case of household-level data. 

{pstd}
There are two options for including information about weights and survey sample design for accurate
estimates and statistical inference. The sampling weight can be entered using 
{weight} or {help svyset}. Information about complex stratified sample designs can also be entered 
using {help svyset} since {cmd:ceqinfra} automatically uses the information specified using {help svyset}. 
Alternatively, the primary sampling unit can be entered using the {opth psu(varname)} option and 
strata can be entered using the {opth s:trata(varname)} option.

{pstd}
By default, {cmd: ceqinfra} does not allow income concept variables to have missing 
values: if a household has 0 income for an income concept, the household should have 0 rather than a missing value. 
If one of these variables has 
missing values, the command will produce an error. For flexibility, however, the command includes an 
{opt ignorem:issing} option that will drop observations with missing values for any of these variables, thus 
allowing the command to run even if there are missing values. 

{pstd}
Results are automatically exported to the CEQ Master Workbook if 
{cmd:using} {it:filename} is specifed in the command, where {it:filename} is the Master Workbook. By 
default, {cmd:ceqinfra} prints to the sheet titled "E21. Infrastructure Access".
Exporting directly to the Master Workbook requires Stata 13 or newer. The Master 
Workbook populated with results from {cmd:ceqinfra} can be automatically opened if the {opt open} 
option is specified (in this case, {it:filename} cannot have spaces). Results are also saved in 
matrices available from {cmd:return list}.
