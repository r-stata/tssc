However, to obtain predictionsfrom the models, use ^zippred^ instead of @predict@. Description-----------^zip^ estimates Zero Inflated Poisson models to count data.  ^zinb^estimates Zero Inflated Negative Binomial models to count data.  Bothmodels allow for "excess zeros" in count models under the assumptionthat the population is characterized by two regimes, one where membersalways have zero counts, and one where members have zero or positivecounts.  The likelihood of being in either regime is estimated using alogit specification, while the counts in the second regime areestimated using a Poisson or Negative Binomial specification.  See Long(1997) Chapter 8 and Greene (1997) for a discussion.^zippred^ will generate predicted counts (using the default ^xb^ option)or the predicted probability of different counts (using ^pr^ob).^zippred^ should be used instead of @predict@. Options for ^zip^ and ^zinb^----------------------------^logit(^varlist^)^ specifies the logit model for predictingmembership in the zero-count regime.  If varlist is not specified, thesame model is used as for the count model.^nolog^ supresses printing of the maximum likelihood iteration details.^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level, in percent, for confidence intervals.  The default is ^level(95)^ or as set by ^set level^.^nobase^ suppresses estimation of the constant only baseline model.This is useful if convergence problems are encountered when estimatingthe baseline model. Options for ^zippred^---------------------^xb^ requests the predicted count.  This is the default.^pr^ob requests the predicted probabilities of different counts.  Theuser should specify J+1 variables to obtain predicted counts for theintegers from 0 to J.  The first variable will contain the predictedprobability, for each observation, of a zero count; the second willcontain the probability of a count of one; and so on. Examples--------..zip  derog  income avgexp ownhome age, logit(income ownhome)..zippred v0-v8, probReferences----------Long, J.
