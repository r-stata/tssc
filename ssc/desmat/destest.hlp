It is used after estimatinga model to perform a Wald test on model terms.The {it:termlist} consists of one or more terms as specified in {help desmat}. A{it:term} can consist of a single variable, or two or more variables separatedby either asterisks or periods. If asterisks are used, they will bechanged into periods by {cmd:destest}, i.e. only the highest orderinteraction will be tested. If no arguments are specified, all termsfrom the last {help desmat} model will be tested.{p}The default is to test whether the effects of each separate term areequal to zero. If the option {cmd:joint} is specified, {cmd:destest} will testinstead whether all the effects in all the terms are jointly equal tozero. If the option {cmd:equal} is specified, {cmd:destest} will test whetherthe effects of each separate term are equal. The {cmd:joint} and {cmd:equal}options may be combined to test whether all effects are jointly equal,although this would be a somewhat peculiar hypothesis. Only the firstletter of the {cmd:joint} and {cmd:equal} option is sigificant.{p}If {cmd:using} {it:filename} is specified then the results are written to a tab-delimited ascii file. The default extension for {it:filename} is {cmd:.out} (cf.{help outsheet}). If {it:filename} already exists, {cmd:desrep} will attempt to find avalid {it:filename} by appending a number (see {help outshee2}). The {cmd:replace} optioncan be used to overwrite an existing file.{title:Options}{p}The options {cmd:ndec()}, {cmd:sigcut()}, {cmd:sigsym()}, {cmd:sigsep()} have the sameusage as in {help desrep}.{p 0 4}{cmd:ndec(}#{cmd:)} specifies the number of decimal places. Default=3.{p 0 4}{cmd:sigcut(}{it:numlist}{cmd:)} specifies levels of significance tobe indicated in the output.{cmd:destest} places a symbol next to the Chi-square orF statistics to indicate whether these are significant at a certain level.The {cmd:sigcut} option is used to specify these levels of significance.The {it:numlist} should contain a list of values in descending orderwith the same number of elements as the string list in {cmd:sigsym}. Forexample, {inp:sigcut(.1 .05 .01 .001)} together with {inp:sigsym(# * ** ***)}will use the symbols {res:#} for p < .1, {res:*} for p < .05, {res:**} for p < .01,and {inp:***} for p < .001. The default is (.05 .01).{p 0 4}{cmd:sigsym(}{it:list}{cmd:)} specifies set of symbols correspondingwith the levels ofsignificance given by {cmd:sigcut}. Default=(* **).{p 0 4}{cmd:sigsep(}#{cmd:)} spcifies the number of spaces between coefficients and symbolsindicating significance. Default=0.{p}The following two options apply only if {cmd:using} has been specified to writethe data to a tab-delimited ascii file:{p 0 4}{cmd:outraw} requests that results be written using theirdefault formats, e.g. %9.0g for floats. In addition, a tab will be insertedbetween coefficients and significance symbols. Otherwise, the variables arewritten with a fixed number of decimal places as specified by the {cmd:ndec}option (default 3) and significance symbols are appended to coefficients if{cmd:sigsep}=0. Default={cmd:nooutraw}.{p 0 4}{cmd:replace} specifies that any existing output file should be replaced.If not specified, {cmd:destest}appends a number to the filename if it already exists. If no valid name hasbeen found after appending 1 to 20, the process stops and the output is notsaved. Default={cmd:noreplace}.{title:Macro variables to control layout}{p}Global macro variables can be used to specify different defaults forthese options, either for the session or for all Stata sessions, byplacing the global variables in the user's {help profile:profile.do}.{cmd:$D_NDEC}{cmd:$D_SIGCUT}{cmd:$D_SIGSYM}{cmd:$D_SIGSEP}{cmd:$D_RAW}{cmd:$D_REPL}{p}Options specified in the {cmd:destest} command string will override theseglobal variables.{title:Notes}{p}{help desmat} creates global macro variables {cmd:$term1}, {cmd:$term2}, etc.containing a {it:varlist} for each term in the model. {cmd:destest} runs througheach of these terms, finds the terms corresponding with the {it:termlist}, and runs{help testparm} with the {it:varlist} corresponding with each term.If these global variables have not beendefined, {cmd:destest} will only print header information. These globalvariables can of course also be used separately in {help testparm}, {help sw}, orrelated programs.{title:Aso see}{p 0 21}{bind: }Manual: {hi:[R] Test}{p_end}{p 0 21}On-line: help for  {help desmat}, {help desrep}, {help outsheet}, {help outshee2}, {help showtrms}, {help test}{p_end}
