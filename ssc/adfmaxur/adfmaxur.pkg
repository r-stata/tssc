"d 'ADFMAXUR': module to calculate Leybourne (1995) ADFmax unit root test statistic along with 1, 5 and 10% finite-sample critical values and associated p-values"
d
d   adfmaxur computes Leybourne (1995) ADFmax unit root tests
d against the alternative of stationarity.  The    command
d accommodates varname with nonzero mean and nonzero trend.
d Allowance is also made for the lag length    to be either fixed
d (FIXED) or determined endogenously using information criteria
"d such as Akaike and Schwarz,    denoted AIC and SIC, respectively."
d A data-dependent procedure often known as the general-to-specific
"d (GTS)    algorithm is also permitted, using significance levels"
"d of 5 and 10%, denoted GTS05 and GTS10, respectively;    see e.g."
d Hall (1994). Approximate p-values are also calculated.
