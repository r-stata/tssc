d 'RADF': module to calculate unit root tests for explosive behaviour
d
d     radf computes the right-tail augmented Dickey-Fuller (1979)
"d (ADF) unit root test, and its further developments based on"
d supremum    statistics derived from ADF-type regressions
"d estimated using recursive windows (Phillips, Wu and Yu, 2011) and"
"d recursive flexible    windows (Phillips, Shi and Yu, 2015).  The"
d command allows for the number of lags of the dependent variable
d in the test regression    and the width of rolling windows to be
d either specified by the user or determined using data-dependent
"d procedures.  Also, it    allows for the implementation of the"
"d date-stamping procedures advocated by Phillips, Wu and Yu (2011)"
"d and Phillips, Shi and Yu    (2015) to identify episodes of"
d explosive behaviour.
