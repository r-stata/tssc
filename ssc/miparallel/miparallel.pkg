d 'MIPARALLEL': module to perform parallel estimation for multiple imputed datasets
d
d  Estimation in multiply imputed data should be a
"d much-parallelizable procedure. Unfortunately, as of Stata 13, the"
d official -mi estimate- command does not support parallel
d estimation. -miparallel- overcomes this by performing estimation
d in parallel by making use of George Vega Yonâ€™s -parallel- in
d multiply imputed datasets. Stata MP is not required. Two commands
d are included: (1) -mipllest- performs an estimation command in
d parallel across several instances of Stata. (2) -mirubin-
d combines the results from the estimation.
