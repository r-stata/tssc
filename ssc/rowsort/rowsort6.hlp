Row sort a set of integer variables
-----------------------------------

    ^rowsort6^ varlist, ^g^enerate^(^newvarlist^)^ [ ^a^scend ^d^escend ]

Description
-----------

^rowsort6^ creates new variables sort_1, ... , sort_p corresponding to 
var_1, ... , var_p in varlist such that sort_1, ... , sort_p contain
the sorted (ordered) values in each observation of varlist. varlist should 
contain all numeric variables with integer values. Missing values are allowed. 

By default, sort_1 contains the lowest value within each observation.
The ^descend^ option may be used to reverse order. 

Note:^rowsort6^ is no longer the current version of ^rowsort^ and 
is only of interest to users of Stata 6 or 7. Users of Stata 8 
upwards should switch to ^rowsort^. 


Remarks
-------

^rowsort6^ loops over observations and may be relatively slow. 
It may be faster to ^reshape^, ^sort^ within blocks, and ^reshape^ again. 


Options
-------

^generate(^newvarlist^)^ specifies new variable names for the 
    variables to be generated, one for each variable in varlist. 
    newvarlist may be specified in hyphenated form, as in ^s1-s5^. 
    This option is required. 

^ascend^ specifies that newvarlist should contain ascending values 
    and is the default.

^descend^ specifies that newvarlist should contain descending values, 
    such that sort_1 contains the largest value in each observation. 


Examples
--------

        . ^rowsort6 x1-x5, gen(s1-s5)^
        . ^rowsort6 x1-x5, gen(s1-s5) descend^
