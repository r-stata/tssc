The resulting test statistic is distributed Chi-squared(N_g) under thenull hypothesis of homoskedasticity. Greene's discussion of Lagrange multiplier, likelihood ratio and standard Waldtest statistics points out that these statistics are sensitive to the assumption of normality of the errors. The modified Wald statistic computed here is workable when the assumption of normality is violated, at least in asymptotic terms. In terms of small sample properties, simulations of the test statistic have shown that its power is very low in the context of fixed effects with "large N, small T" panels. In that circumstance, the test should be used with caution.One modification to Greene's formulae has been applied to allow for unbalancedpanels (in which T(i), the number of observations per cross-sectional unit, isnot constant across units). All sums are computed over the actual T(i) for the cross-sectional unit.The test statistic, degrees of freedom and p-value are placed in the return array. Example-------	. ^use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/greene2000/tbl15-1.dta,clear^	. ^iis firm^		. ^xtreg i f c if firm!=2,fe^		. ^xttest3^		. ^xtgls i f c if firm!=2, p(h)^		. ^xttest3^References----------Greene, W.
