Where Z(nxk) and X(nxm) with k<=4.	The program runs n!/(k!(n-k)!) OLS regressions by	taking combinations of k<=4 Z variables among the p listed. It then	displays minimum and maximum parameter estimates for "var2" together 	with their t-statistics, p-value and Z variables used. This version	controls for multicollinearity through -vif.ado- already coming	with stata.References: 	Levine R. and D.

If it is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.^level(^#^)^ tells the program within what confidence level the minimum and	maximum for "ebavar" should be reported. If it is not specified, 	it is assumed to be 0.95.^vif(^#^)^ controls for the collinearity problem. It sets the maximum	admissible VIF below which extremes have to be found. If it is not	specified, the maximum is by default very high: i.e. it allows for 	a high collinearity in the auxiliary regressions.	N.B. 	VIF is calculated for each of the n!/(k!(n-k)!) regressions		and it slows down the program considerably. Hope to solve this		sometime.^ci(^#^)^ modyfies the confidence for the intervals of both the minimum and 	maximum for "ebavar". If it is not specified, it is assumed to be .95.^detail^ displays parameter estimate, t-statistics, p-value, maximum VIF	and relative Z 	variables for all regressions performed.Examples--------	. ^eba y x1 x2 x3^	. ^eba y x1-x3, x(x4-x6)^	. ^eba y x1 x2 x3 x4 x5, type(4)^	. ^eba y x1 x2 x3 x4 x5, x(x6) type(4) detail le(.85) ci(.90)^	. ^eba y x1 x2 x3 x4 x5, x(x6) type(4) detail le(.85) vif(10) ci(.90)^Also see-------- Manual:  ^[R] fit^On-line:  help for @fit@Author------	Gregorio Impavido	DECVP	The World Bank	Washington, DC	Gimpavido@@worldbank.org
