The restricted regression is nested within its unrestrictedcounterpart, and the validity of the restrictions may be evaluated by a standard F-test comparing the restricted and unrestricted models' goodness of fit, as described in any econometrics textbook.  ^cnsrsig^ may be used following a  ^cnsreg^ command to generate the F-statistic for the null hypothesis that the restrictions are consistent with the data. A likelihoodratio statistic is also generated.This command can only be run after the @cnsreg@ command.The command defines several scalars for later use; see ^return list^.Examples--------	. ^constraint def 1 price=weight^	. ^constraint def 2 displ=weight^	. ^cnsreg price displ weight mpg^	. ^cnsrsig^	. ^dis r(F)^	. ^dis r(ncns)^	. ^dis r(lrt)^Authors-------       Christopher F Baum       Boston College, Chestnut Hill MA 02467 USA       baum@@bc.edu              Vince Wiggins, Stata Corporation       vwiggins@@stata.comAlso see--------On-line:  ^help^ for @cnsreg@
