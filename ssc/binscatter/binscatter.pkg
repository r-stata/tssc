d 'BINSCATTER': module to generate binned scatterplots
d
"d  binscatter generates binned scatterplots, and is optimized for"
d speed in large  datasets.  Binned scatterplots provide a
d non-parametric way of visualizing the relationship between two
"d variables.  With a large number of observations, a scatterplot"
d that plots every data point would become too crowded to interpret
d visually.  binscatter groups the x-axis variable into equal-sized
"d bins, computes the mean of the x-axis and y-axis variables within"
"d each bin, then creates a scatterplot of these data points.  It"
d provides built-in options to control for covariates before
d plotting the relationship.  It will also plot fit lines based on
"d the underlying data, and can automatically handle regression"
d discontinuities.
