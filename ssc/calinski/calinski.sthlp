{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:calinski} calculates the Calinski-Harabasz pseudo-F for
stopping rules in cluster analysis, from the pairwise distance matrix.
This is widely used to determine the optimum number of clusters. Stata's
default {helpb cluster stop} does the same calculation on the basis of the
original variables, but cannot operate on the distance matrix.
{cmd:calinski} is thus useful when the original variables are not
available, or when the distances are created other than as squared
Euclidean distances between variables (as is the case for instance with
sequence analysis). {p_end}

{pstd} {bf:NB:} Stata's built-in {cmd:clustermat stop, variables(...)}
does {it:not} estimate the CH pseudo-F on the distance matrix used by
{cmd:clustermat}. Rather, it creates a new temporary distance matrix
based on the variables listed in the {cmd:variables()} option. {p_end}

{pstd}{cmd:calinski} depends on {help discrepancy} which
can be installed from SSC:{p_end}

{phang}{cmd:. ssc install discrepancy}

{pstd}Returns:{p_end}
      
{phang}r(calinski_#)       Calinski-Harabasz pseudo-F for # groups{p_end}


{title:Remarks}

{pstd}While {cmd:cluster stop} and {cmd:clustermat stop} estimate the
CH pseudo-F by cumulating the sum of squares from ANOVAs of the original
variables on the cluster solution, and are therefore explicitly rooted in
a squared-Euclidean distance point of view, {cmd:calisnki} takes the
distances as they are found. If they are squared distances based on the
original variables, the results will be identical to {cmd:cluster stop}.
If they are squared Euclidean distances from another source, the
interpretation will be the same. If they are other sorts of differences
(e.g., non-Euclidean) the interpretation is not necessarily the same,
but can be understood to be analogous, in the same way as the
{cmd:discrepancy} partitioning of the distance matrix (described by
Studer et al 2011) is analogous to ANOVA.{p_end}

{pstd}Because the order of the data and the order of the distance matrix
must coincide, the dataset must be sorted by {opt id:var}. It is the
user's responsibility that this variable defines the correct order.{p_end}
