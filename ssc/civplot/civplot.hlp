Each confidence interval is by default shown as a vertical line.The groups on the horizontal axis are tacitly plotted at 1, ... , number of intervals with value labels from the actual values or variable names. Options-------^by(^byvar^)^ defines a grouping variable. It is only allowed when a     single variable is specified. ^by( )^ is treated as categorical, not     measured. ^level(^#^)^, ^poisson^, ^binomial^ and ^exposure(^varname^)^ are all    options of ^ci^. See help on @ci@.^total^ adds a final line showing the mean and confidence interval for    all groups specified. It is only allowed in conjunction with ^by( )^. graph_options are options of ^graph^. See help on @graph@. Note that     ^xlabel(1/^number of intervals^)^ is wired in.     ^symbol^ defaults to ^"oii"^ (a circle for the mean and invisible     symbols for the the mean).         ^connect^ defaults to ^".II"^.     Titles filled in by default may be blanked out or, more generally,    overwritten by options such as ^b2(" ") or t1("  ")^. Examples--------    . ^civplot length, by(grade) yla(0(200)1200)^    . ^civplot length, by(grade) yla(0(200)1200) sy(Sii) c(.||)^    . ^civplot length width, yla(0(200)1200) xsc(0.5,2.5) b2("  ")^ Author------         Nicholas J.
