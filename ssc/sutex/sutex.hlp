If {cmdab:file:(string)} is specified, the code is written to the specified file (if {cmdab:repl:ace} is not specified, then the code is appended to the existing file, if any).{p}Otherwise, the code is displayed in the output window.{p}When {cmdab:long:table} is selected, and if you {it:\usepackage{longtable}} in the preamble of your TeX document, tables can span over several pages    {p}The [{cmdab:dig:its(integer)}] option defines the number of digits to be displayed (default is 3).{p}The [{cmdab:lab:els}] option allows to display variable labels (if they exist) instead of variable names.{p}The [{cmdab:par:}] option adds parentheses to Std. Dev.{p}The [{cmdab:nobs:}] option adds a column with the number of observations for each variable (automatically specified if variables do not have the same number of observations).{p}The [{cmdab:min:max}] option adds two columns with the minimum and maximum of each variable.{p}The [{cmdab:na:(string)}] option allows to define the content of cells where a numerical value has no sense (for example a Std. Dev. for only one observation). ATTENTION : do not use the following characters # $ % & ~ _ ^ \ { } in that option.{p}The [{cmdab:tit:le(string)}] option defines the table title ({it:Summary statistics} is default).{p}The [{cmdab:key(string)}] option defines the table label ({it:sumstat} is default).{p}The [{cmdab:long:table}] option allows to create tables that span over several pages using the "supertabular" package (do not forget to {it:\usepackage{longtable}} in the preamble of your .tex document){p}The [{cmdab:pl:acement}] option specifies the placement of the table in the .tex doc (default is {it:htbp}) {p_end}{p}The [{cmdab:nocheck}] option skips the LaTeX special characters search-and-replaceroutine. This option should be used in two cases :- either you are sure there are no LaTeX special characters within variable names or labels, and want to speed-up the command,- or you deliberately included LaTeX special characters and do not want {cmd:sutex} to translate them.{p}The [{cmdab:file:(string)}] writes the LaTeX code in the specified ASCII file (if no extension is given, {it:.tex} is assumed), nothing is diplayed in the output window.{p}The [{cmdab:append:}] option (to be used in conjunction with {cmdab:file:(string)}) appends the code to the specified file.{p}The [{cmdab:repl:ace}] option (to be used in conjunction with {cmdab:file:(string)}) overwrites any existing file with the same name.{p}If the LaTeX code is displayed in the output window, one just has to copy/paste it into a LaTeX editor (in Scientific Word, it has to be pasted into a "TeX field"){p}If a file is written, {cmd:sutex} displays "file {it:filename} saved". The content of {it:filename} can be viewed by clicking on it.{title:Examples}{p 8 16}{inp:. sutex if foreign==0, labels digits(5)}{p_end}{p 8 16}{inp:. by foreign : sutex, labels minmax longtable key(ltab)}{p_end}{p 8 16}{inp:. sutex, labels file(C:/myfiles/mytables.tex) replace}{p_end}{p 8 16}{inp:. by foreign : sutex, labels file(C:/myfiles/mytables.tex) append}{p_end}{title:Also see}{p 0 21}On-line:  help for {help summarize}{p_end}{p 10 21}help for {help outtex}, {help maketex}, {help outreg}, {help outtable} if installed{p_end}{.-}Questions, comments and bug-reports can be sent to terracol@univ-paris1.fr{.-}
