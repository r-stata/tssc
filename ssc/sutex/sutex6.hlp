.-Help for ^sutex6^                            .-Generates LaTeX code for summary statistics tables..-^sutex6^ [if] [in] [aweight fweight], [^DIG^its(integer)] [^LAB^els] [^PAR^]		[NOBS] [MINmax] [NA(string)] [^TIT^le(string)] [^KEY^(string)]       		  [^LONG^table] [^PL^ace(string)] [^NOCH^eck].-The [^DIG^its(integer)] option defines the number of digits to be displayed (default is 3).The [^LAB^els] option allows to display variable labels (if they exist) instead of variable names.The [^PAR^] option adds parentheses to Std. Dev.The [^NOBS^] option adds a column with the number of observations for each variable (automatically specified if variables do not have the same number of observations).The [^MIN^max] option adds two columns with the minimum and maximum of each variable.The [^NA^(string)] option allows to define the content of cells where a numerical value has no sense (for example a Std. Dev. for only one observation). ATTENTION : do not use the following characters # $ % & ~ _ ^ \ { } in that option.The [^TIT^le(string)] option defines the table title ("Summary statistics" is default).The [^KEY^(string)] option defines the table label ("sumstat" is default).The [^LONG^table] option allows to create tables that span over several pages using the "longtable" package (do not forget to \usepackage{longtable} in the preamble)The [^PL^ace(string)] option specifies the placement of the table in the .tex doc (default is htbp)The [^NOCH^eck] option skips the LaTeX special characters search-and-replaceroutine. This option should be used in two cases :- either you are sure there are no LaTeX special characters within variable names or labels, and want to speed-up the command,- or you deliberately included LaTeX special characters and do not want ^sutex6^ to translate them..-The LaTeX code is displayed in the output window, one just has to copy/paste it into a LaTeX editor (in Scientific Word, it has to be pasted into a "TeX field").-Examplessutex6sutex6 if foreign==0, labels digits(5) sutex6, labels minmax digits(5) longtable key(stab).-Also see @summarize@ @outtex6@ @outtable@ (if installed)..-Author :Antoine Terracol (questions, comments and bug-report can be sent to terracol at univ-paris1.fr).-
