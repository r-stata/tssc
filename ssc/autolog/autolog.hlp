Utility for dialog box to create log files
------------------------------------------

    ^autolog using^ filename [,^sm^ ^path(^dirpath^)^]


Description
-----------

^autolog^ is a utility designed for use in Stata's profile.do 
file (though it can be used interactively if desired).

^autolog^ causes a dialogue box to pop up every time Stata starts 
and prompts the user for a filename for the log file. This allows
the user to easily enter project filenames depending on what analysis
is underway. ^autolog^ is also designed to overcome the common 
frustration of forgetting to send output to a log file at the 
start of a session.

The input required for the command line (^using^) is the filename of the 
default file where output will be sent when no filename is entered
in the dialogue box. This happens when the user presses Esc when 
confronted by the dialogue box. A typical name might be "basic" or
"default". See examples below.

Options
-------

^sm^ in the command line indicates that the log file should use
Stata's smcl format. Omitting the ^sm^ option causes the log 
file to be written as a plain text file.

^path(^dirpath^)^ in the command line indicates that both the
dialogue box file and the default file are to be placed in that 
directory. Omitting the ^path^ option places these file in the
current working directory.

Examples
--------

^autolog using basic, sm path(d:\data\current\projects)^

^autolog using default, path(d:\data\projects)^

^autolog^ should ideally be entered in the profile.do file
(found in Stata's program directory). An example follows:

set memory 150m
set matsize 800
set varlabelpos 20
cd d:\data
autolog using basic, path(d:\data\logfiles)
noisily di 
noisily di "This session began at: $S_TIME on: $S_DATE"
noisily di
