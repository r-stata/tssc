The standardizationutilizes the stratum-specific rates of a standard population to calculate theexpected number of cases in the study population(s), sums them and thencompares them to the actual number of cases observed.  The standardpopulation's information must be contained in another Stata data file andspecified via ^using^ on the command line.^casevar^ is the variable name for the study population's number of cases(deaths). It must be an integer and it must have the same value for allobservations or missing in all but one observation in each subpopulationidentified by the ^groupvars^.^popvar^ identifies the number of subjects represented by each observation inthe study population.^stratavars^ define the strata. Options- -------^by(^groupvars^)^ it specifies the variables identifying the study populationsif more than one exist in the data.^popvars(^case_vars pop_var^)^ or ^rate(^rate_var #|crude_var^)^ must bespecified.  Only one of these two options is allowed.  These options are usedto describe the standard population's data where:	 Variables used with ^rate^ option:         ^rate_var^    variable containing the strata specific rates.         ^#|crude_var^ is used to specify the crude case rate either via a                       variable name or optionally by its value.  If the crude                       rate variable is used it must be the same for all                       observations or missing in all but one.	 Variables used with ^popvars^ option:         ^case_vars^   variable for the number of cases (deaths) for		       each stratum in the standard population.          ^pop_var^i   variable representing the total number of individuals                       in each stratum (individuals at risk).^print^ outputs a tabulate summary of the standard population beforeoutputting the study populations.^format(%^fmt^)^ specifies the format to use for displaying the summary table.The default is ^%10.0g^; see help @%fmt@.^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level, in percent, for the confidenceinterval of the adjusted rate; see help @level@.Example- -------.. ^istdize deaths pop age race  using USstd.dta, by(year) rate(USrate crude)^.. ^istdize deaths pop age race sex using USstd, by(year) rate(USrate 0.0095)^Also see- --------Manual:  ^[R] dstdize^On-line:  help for @epitab@, @dstdize@
