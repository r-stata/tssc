d 'XTOOS': module for evaluating the out-of-sample prediction performance of panel-data models
d
d  The package XTOOS includes four new commands that allow to
d evaluate the out-of-sample prediction performance of panel-data
d models in their time-series and cross-individual dimensions
"d separately, also with separate procedures for different types of"
d dependent variablesâ€”either continuous or dichotomous variables.
"d  The name of the commands are xtoos_t, xtoos_i, xtoos_bin_t, and"
d xtoos_bin_i.    The time-series procedures (xtoos_t and
d xtoos_bin_t) exclude a number of time periods defined by the user
d from the estimation sample for each individual in the panel.
"d Similarly, the cross-individual procedures (xtoos_i and"
"d xtoos_bin_i) exclude a group of individuals (for example,"
d countries) defined by the user from the estimation sample
"d (including all their observations throughout time). Then, for the"
"d remaining subsamples (training-sample), they fit the specified"
d models and use the resulting parameters to forecast the dependent
d variable (or the probability of a positive outcome) in the unused
d time-periods or the unused individuals (testing-sample). The
d unused time-period or individual sets are then recursively
d reduced by one period in every subsequent step in the time-series
"d dimension, or in either a random or an ordered fashion in the"
d cross-individual dimension.  The estimation and forecasting
d evaluation are repeated until there are no more periods ahead or
d more individuals that could be evaluated. In the continuous
"d cases, the model's forecasting performance is reported both in"
"d absolute terms (RMSE) and relative to a naive prediction, by"
"d means of a U-Theil ratio. In the dichotomous case, the prediction"
d performance is evaluated based on the area under the receiver
d operator characteristic (ROC) statistic evaluated in both the
d training sample and the out of sample. The procedures allow to
"d choose different estimation methods, including some dynamic"
"d methodologies, and could also be used in a time-series or a"
d cross-section dataset only. They also allow evaluating the
d model's forecasting performance for one particular individual or
d for a defined group of individuals instead of the whole panel.
