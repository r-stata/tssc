CACI, August 1999 (v1.2).-Kuder-Richardson coefficient of reliability-------------------------------------------     ^kr20^ varlist [^if^ exp][^in^ range], [sort(sortkey)]Description-----------Computes the reliability coefficient of a set of dichotomous items, whereasCronbach's alpha is used for multipoint scales.In addition, ^kr20^ computes:     - the item difficulty (proportion of 'right' answers),     - the average value of item difficulty,     - the item variance,     - the corrected item-test point-biserial correlation coefficients,     - the average value of corrected item-test correlation coefficients.The items must be coded as:       - '0' for a wrong answer (unexpected answer),      - '1' for a right answer (expected answer).Global macros-------------KR20 saves four results in the following global macros      - $S_3: average value of item difficulties      - $S_4: average value of corrected item-test PB correlation coefficients      - $S_5: number of items      - $S_6: KR20 Options-------^sort(sortkey)^ to sort the output by 'item' name (alphabetically), or by'DIFFiculty' level or 'CORRelation' coefficient.Also see--------    STB:  ^alpha2^ in sg66 (STB-35) Manual:  ^[R] alpha^On-line:  help for @factor@
