.-help for ^normtest^by Herve M. CACI, September 2000 (v 1.2).-Tests of univariate/multivariate kurtosis and skewness------------------------------------------------------     ^normtest^ varlist [^if^ exp][^in^ range]Description-----------Computes measures and tests of univariate skew (g1, sqrt(b1)) andkurtosis (g2 and b2-3), and two omnibus tests of normality: namelyD'agostino & Pearson K sq, and Jarque-Bera LM.Fisher's g statistics are given, while "sqrt(b1)" and "b2" arealready computed by Stata's ^summarize^ command when specifyingthe "detail" option.D'agostino & Pearson Ksq is similar to Shapiro-Wilk W.Computes measures and tests of multivariate skew (Small's Q1 andSrivastava's b1p) and kurtosis (Small's Q2, Srivastava's b2p, andMardia's b2p), plus an omnibus test which combines VQ1 and VQ2.Finally shows the 5 observations with larger Mahalanobisdistances, and graphs the ordered squared distances.Note----This ado draws on a SPSS macro by Prof. Lawrence DeCarlo(decarlo@exchange.tc.columbia.edu).
