{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd: spundir} generates an undirected dyad contagion spatial effect variable for analysis of spatial dependence in undirected dyad data.
It can create spatial effect variables for spatial lag, spatial-x and spatial error models.
See Neumayer and Plümper (2010) for an exposition of all possible forms of contagion in dyadic data.
See Plümper and Neumayer (2010) for a discussion of model specification in the analysis of spatial dependence.

{pstd}
See {browse "http://personal.lse.ac.uk/neumayer/spundir.htm"}.

{title:Arguments}

{phang}
{opt lagvar} is the variable to be spatially lagged. It is the undirected dyadic dependent variable in spatial lag models, a selected independent
variable in spatial-x models and a saved regression residual in spatial error models.

{phang}
{opt w:eightvar(varname)} is the weighting or connectivity variable linking unit {it}i{sf} with unit {it}j{sf}. It must be numeric
and must not contain negative values. It may or may not be directed.

{phang}
{opt i(varname)} is the identifying variable of unit {it}i{sf}. It can be a numeric or string variable.

{phang}
{opt j(varname)} is the identifying variable of unit {it}j{sf}. It can be a numeric or string variable.


{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt link(options)} is required. The following options are allowed:
{it}ik{sf}, {it}ki{sf}, {it}jm{sf}, {it}mj{sf}, {it}ik+jm{sf}, {it}ki+mj{sf},
{it}ik*jm{sf}, and {it}ki*mj{sf}.
Option {it}ik{sf} requests that the virtually transformed weighting variable {opt w:eightvar(varname)} is to represent connectivity from unit {it}i{sf}
to other units {it}k{sf}. Option {it}ki{sf} requests connectivity from other units {it}k{sf} to unit {it}i{sf}. 
Option {it}jm{sf} requests connectivity from unit {it}j{sf} to other units {it}m{sf}. 
Option {it}mj{sf} requests connectivity from other units {it}m{sf} to unit {it}j{sf}. 
Option {it}ik+jm{sf} requests that the weighting matrix represents the {it}sum{sf} of connectivities invoked by {it}ik{sf} and {it}jm{sf}.
Option {it}ki+mj{sf} does the same, but for the sum of connectivities invoked by {it}ki{sf} and {it}mj{sf}. 
Option {it}ik*jm{sf} requests that the weighting matrix represents the {it}product{sf} of connectivities invoked by {it}ik{sf} and {it}jm{sf}.
Option {it}ki*mj{sf} does the same, but for the product of connectivities invoked by {it}ki{sf} and {it}mj{sf}. 

{phang}
{opt time(varname)} is an optional argument. If users wish to generate a time-varying spatial effect variable, then the numeric time variable must be stated here.

{phang}
{opt excl:usive} specifies that all dyads containing either unit {it}i{sf} or unit {it}j{sf} are excluded from having a spatial
effect on dyad {it}ij{sf}.

{phang}
{opt nor:owst} requests that the generated spatial effect variable is not row-standardized.
See Plümper and Neumayer (2010) for an explanation and discussion of row-standardization.
Row-standardization is the default option.

{phang}
{opt nom:erge} requests that the generated spatial effect variable is not automatically merged into the original data set.

{phang}
{opt se:name(name)} names the generated spatial effect variable. In the default option,
if the weighting matrix is row-standardized, then the generated spatial effect variable is called SE_var_undirdyad_rowst. If the weighting matrix
is not row-standardized, then a file is saved in the current working directory called SE_var_undirdyad_norowst. 
Any previously existing variable with the same name will be replaced.

{phang}
{opt label:name(name)} names the label of the generated spatial effect variable. The default label given is
"Undirected dyad contagion spatial effect variable".

{phang}
{opt file:name(name)} requests that a dataset containing the generated spatial effect variable is saved
in the current working directory under the defined name. In the default option, if the weighting matrix
is row-standardized, then the saved file is called SE_file_undirdyad_rowst.
If the weighting matrix is not row-standardized, then the saved file is called SE_file_undirdyad_norowst. 
Any previously existing file with the same name will be replaced.
