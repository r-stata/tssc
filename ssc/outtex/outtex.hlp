If {cmdab:file:(string)} is specified, the code is written to the specified file.{p}Otherwise, the code is displayed in the output window.{p}When {cmdab:long:table} is selected, and if you {it:\usepackage{longtable}} in the preamble of your TeX document, tables can span over several pages    {title:Options}{title:1. Display options}{p}By default, {cmd:outtex} generates a table of the following form :{p_end}{p} Variable name | Coefficient|significance level symbol | (Std. Err){p_end}{p} {inp:. "Variable name" in a left-aligned column}{p_end}{p} {inp:. "Coefficient" in a right-aligned column}{p_end}{p} {inp:. No intercolumn space between the Coeff. column and the symbol column ; which goes in a left-aligned column}{p_end}{p} {inp:. "Std.Err" between parentheses in a centered column"}{p_end}Combining [{cmdab:plain:}] and [{cmdab:bel:ow}] can give up to four different layouts : {p}The [{cmdab:bel:ow}] option puts standards errors below the coefficient.{p_end}{p}If [{cmd:plain}] is specified, the significance level symbols are put on the same column as the coefficients, and the column is centered.{p} {cmd:outtex}, level below gives {p_end}Variable name | Coefficient|sign.lev.symb.|              |   (Std.Err)|              |{p} {cmd:outtex}, level plain gives {p_end}Variable name | Coefficient + sign.lev.symb. | (Std.Err) |{p} {cmd:outtex}, level below plain gives {p_end} Variable name | Coefficient+sign.lev.symb. |               |        (Std.Err)           |{p}The [{cmdab:dig:its(integer)}] option defines the number of digits to be displayed (default is 3).{p}The [{cmdab:lab:els}] option allows to display variable labels (if they exist) instead of variable names.{p}The [{cmdab:lev:el}] option adds symbols according to the coefficient's significance level.{p}The [{cmdab:le:gend}] option adds a legend correspondig to significance levels symbols.{p_end}{p} NB : [{cmdab:leg:end}] implies [{cmdab:lev:el}] {p_end}{p}The [{cmdab:de:tails}] option adds details such as R2 ,chi2, LL...{p}The [{cmdab:nop:ar}] option supresses the parentheses around the Std. Err.{p}The [{cmdab:tit:le(string)}] option defines the table title (Default is {it:Estimation result} followed by the command name).{title:2. Other options}{p}The [{cmdab:key(string)}] option defines the table label ({it:tabresult} is default).{p}The [{cmdab:long:table}] option allows to create tables that span over several pages using the "longtable" package (do not forget to {it:\usepackage{longtable}} in the preamble of your .tex document){p} The [{cmdab:pl:acement}] option specifies the placement of the table in the .tex doc (default is {it:htbp}){p}The [{cmdab:nocheck}] option skips the LaTeX special characters search-and-replaceroutine. This option should be used in two cases :- either you are sure there are no LaTeX special characters within variable names or labels, and want to speed-up the command,- or you deliberately included LaTeX special characters and do not want {cmd:outtex} to translate them.{p}The [{cmdab:file:(string)}] option writes the LaTeX code in the specified ASCII file (if no extension is given, {it:.tex} is assumed), nothing is displayed in the output window.{p}The [{cmdab:append:}] option (to be used with {cmdab:file:(string)}) appends the code to the specified file.{p}The [{cmdab:repl:ace}] option (to be used with {cmdab:file:(string)}) overwrites any existing file with the same name.{title:Notes}{p}If the LaTeX code is displayed in the output window, one just has to copy/paste it into a LaTeX editor (in Scientific Word, it has to be pasted into a "TeX field"){p}If a file is written, {cmd:outtex} displays "file {it:filename} saved". The content of {it:filename} can be viewed by clicking on it.{title:Examples}{p 8 16}{inp:. outtex}{p_end}{p 8 16}{inp:. outtex, labels level detail legend supertabular key(stab)}{p_end}{p 8 16}{inp:. outtex, labels level below file(C:/myfiles/mytables.tex) replace}{p_end}{title:Also see}{p 0 21}On-line:  help for {help summarize}{p_end}{p 10 21}help for {help sutex}, {help maketex}, {help outreg}, {help outtable} if installed{p_end}{.-}Questions, comments and bug-reports can be sent to terracol@univ-paris1.fr{.-}
