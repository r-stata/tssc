The tests differ with respect to the specification of residual variances under the alternative hypothesis.   ^white^ considers the general (unrestricted) alternative hypothesis in    which no assumptions is made on the residual variances (White 1980).   ^szroeter^ considers the alternative hypothesis that the residual variances    are monotonically increasing in some variable (Szroeter 1978).   ^htest^ performs standard score tests for H: b=0 for two parametric forms of    heteroscedasticity:       ^multiplicative heteroscedastcity^ (Cook & Weinberg 1983)           var(y) = s^^2 * exp( b1.z1 + b2.z2 + .. + bk.zk)       ^random coefficient heteroscedasticity^ (REF)               var(y) = s^^2 + b1.z1^^2 + b2.z2^^2 + .. + bk.zk^^2   If no varlist is specified, ^htest^ uses the fitted values of the regression.^szoeter^ and ^htest^ test homoscedasticity against specific models (monotonicity; multiplicative and random coefficient heteroscedasticty) under the alternative hypothesis. Due to the general structure of the alternative, ^white^ is not very powerfull against any particular form of heteroscedasticity.         Options (^htest^)- -------^rhs^ specifies that the independent variables of the ^fit^ted regression     should be used.^univar^ specifies that univariate score tests for each of the variables is     displayed in addition to the "combined" test.If ^htest^ suggest multiplicative forms of heteroscedasticity, regression models can be estimated using ^regmh^ or ^regmhv^ . The random coefficient model is currently not supported.Options (^white^)- -------^preserve^ specifies that the ^white^ may ^preserve^ the data in memory and     drop all variables and cases that are not needed in the calculations. This     is costly for large data sets. However, ^white^ has to generate k(k+1)/2     temporary variables, where k = #rhs-vars in the ^fit^ted model. Examples- --------     . ^fit income edu sex exp exp2 industry^             (fit a regression model)    . ^white^                                       . ^szroeter edu^                                 (variance increases in edu?)    . ^htest^                                 (homoscedasticity in fitted values)     . ^htest edu sex exp exp2 industry^            (homoscedasticity in rhs-vars)     . ^htest, rhs^                       (shorthand for the previous command)     . ^htest edu exp age, univar^  (display univariate tests as well)Details (^white^)- -------White (1980) noted that the classical estimate         Vc = s^2 inv(X'X)of the variance V of OLS regression estimates and the Huber/White/robust estimate         Vr = X' inv(sum e_i^2 x_i x_i') Xof V are likely to be close under homoscedasticity. White (1980) proposed a Hausmann-type test of the matrix difference Vc-Vr as a test for homoscedasticy against general forms of heteroscedasticity. (Actually, White showed that Vc and Vr may also be close under particular forms of hetero-scedasticty as well. See White (1980) for details.)Details (^szroeter^)- -------Szoeter's class of tests for homoscedasticity against the alternative that the residual variance increases in some variable x are defined in terms of          sum_i h(x(i)) e(i)^^2     H =  --------------------          i=1..n             sum_i e(i)^^2 where h(x) is some weight function that increases in x. Note that H can be interpreted as a weighted avarege of the h(x), weighted by the squares residuals. Under homoscedasticty, H should be approximately equal to the unweighted average of h(x). Large values of H suggest that e(i)^^2 tends to be large where h(x) is large, i.e., the variance indeed increases in x, while small values of H suggest that the variance actually decreases in x.King (1982) suggest to use h(x(i)) = rank(x(i) in x(1)..x(n)). The Q-statistic displayed by ^szroeter^ is a transformation of H that is asymptotically standard normal distributed under homoscedasticity.^szroeter^ displays a Q-statistic (Judge 1985:452). Under homoscedasticity, Q is approximately N(0,1) distributed. Q>2 suggests that the residual variance increases in varname, while Q<-2 suggests that it decreases in varname.Homoscedastity and weighted regression- --------------------------------------References- ----------    Cook, R.D., and S.
