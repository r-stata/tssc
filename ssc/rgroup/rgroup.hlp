This estimator is an alternative to other estimators ofthe variance of sample statistics for survey data e.g. the jackknifeor taylor linearization. The application of the random group estimatorrequires, that random groups are already defined during datacollection. This for example is the case in the GSOEP, the GermanSocio-economic Panel.^rgroup^ runs the user-specified command for each group of thevariable in ^rgroup()^ and uses the results to calculate the standarderrors of the statistics in ^exp_list^.As ^command^ any command may be used. Further all elements of thatcommand are allowed. Every accessible single statistic after that command may be used tobuild the exp_list.  The expressions in exp_list must be separated byspaces and there must be no spaces within each expression.  Note thatcommand and exp_list must both be enclosed in double quotes.The syntax of rgroup works like that of @bs@. ^rgroup^ stores its results r(). Options-------^rgroups(^varname^)^ specifies the variable, which contains the random     groups. Examples-------- . ^rgroup "sum xvar" "r(mean)", rg(rgroups)^ . ^rgroup "reg y x1 x2 x3" "_b[x1] _b[x2] _b[x3]", rg(rgroups)^  . ^rgroup "reg y x1 x2 x3" "e(r2)", rg(rgroups)^ Author------    Ulrich Kohler     ukohler@@sowi.uni-mannheim.deReferences----------    Wolter (1985) "Introduction to Variance estimation", New    York/Berlin (Springer)    Note for ^SOEP^ Users: The estimation is described in K.4Acknowledgments---------------     rgroup.ado builds up on ranvar.ado, written by Frauke Kreuter, University    of Konstanz and bs.ado, written by StataCorp.Also see-------- Manual: ^[U] 23 Estimation and post-estimation commands^         ^[R] return, [R] saved results [R] estimation commands^On-line: help for @est@, @postest@, @return@ , @ranvar@ (if installed)
