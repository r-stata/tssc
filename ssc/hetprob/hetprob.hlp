If you type 	. ^hetprob y x1 x2 x3, variance(z1 z2)^^hetprob^ estimates b0, b1, b2, b3, g1, and g2 of	Pr(y~=0) = F( b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3  where                                     s^^2 = exp(g1*x1 + g2*z2) )                 = F( [b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3] / 						exp[(g1*x1 + g2*x2)] )Examples---------	. ^hetprob outcome bp age, v(group1 group2)^	. ^hetprob works educ sex, v(age)^	. ^hetprob works age, v(age)^Calculating predicted values-----------------------------After ^hetprob^ estimation, you can calculate predicted probabilities of a positive outcome by typing 	. ^predict i1^	. ^predict s, eq(ln_var)^	. ^replace s = exp(s/2)^	. ^gen p = normprob(i1/s)^Authors--------William Gould <wgould@@stata.com>James Hardin  <jhardin@@stata.com>This is work in progress.
