That is, thecoefficient (i.e., point) estimates produced by ^ivglog^ are similar to thecoefficient estimates produced by ^glm^ ...^, family(ig) link(log)^; seehelp @glm@.  The standard errors, however, will be slightly different sincethe log link is not the canonical link for the inverse Gaussian family.^ivglog^ estimates distributions with a typically high initial peak witha long tail. It can be used to estimate otherwise log-gamma of negativebinomial models with extremely long right-hand tails; see help @gammalog@and help @nbreg@.The outcome variable assumed for ^ivglog^ is continuous and is strictlygreater than zero.  (^ivglog^ does not allow depvar to take on the value zeroor any negative value.)Options--------^irr^ and ^eform^ both do the same thing.  They report estimated coefficients    transformed to incidence-rate ratios.      ^robust^ specifies the Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance is to be used    in place of the traditional calculation; see ^[U] 23.11 Obtaining robust^    ^variance estimates^.  ^robust^ combined with ^cluster()^ allows observations    which are not independent within cluster (although they be be independent    between clusters).  If you specify ^pweight^s, ^robust^ is implied.^cluster(^varname^)^ specifies that the observations are independent across groups    (clusters) but not necessarily within groups.  varname specifies to which    group each observation belongs; e.g., ^cluster(personid)^ in data with    repeated observations on individuals.  See ^[U] 23.11 Obtaining robust^    ^variance estimates^.  ^cluster()^ can be used with @pweight@s to produce esti-    mates for unstratified cluster-sampled data.  Specifying ^cluster()^ implies    ^robust^.^score(^newvars^)^ creates newvar containing each observation's contribution to the    score; see ^[U] 23.12 Obtaining scores^.  If two new varnames are specified,    then the score from the ancillary parameter equation is also saved.^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level, in percent, for confidence intervals;    see help @level@.maximize_options control the maximization process; see help @maximize@.  You    should never have to specify them.Options for ^predict^--------------------^n^, calculates the predicted value of depvar, exp(x_j*b)^xb^ calculates the linear prediction.^stdp^ calculates the standard error of the linear prediction.Examples---------  . ^ivglog los age sex, eform^  . ^ivglog los age sex, cluster(hospital) nolog sc(scr1 scr2)^  . ^predict mu, n^  . ^predict linear, xb^Also see--------- Manual:  ^[U] 23 Estimation and post-estimation commands^,	  ^[U] 29 Overview of model estimation in Stata^,On-line:  help for @est@, @postest@; @glm@, @nbreg@, @poisson@, @zinb@See also: help for @gammalog@Help------Joseph HilbeArizona State Universityemail: hilbe@@asu.edu;      jhilbe@@aol.com
