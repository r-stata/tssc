For observations where this variable takes on a value of zero, the actual value is equal to the observed value of y1 (no censoring).  For observations where this variable takes on a value of one, the actual value is above the observed value of y1 (left censoring).  For observations where this variable takes on a value of negative one, the actual value is less than the observed value of y1 (right censoring).{pstd}{opt censor2} designates the variable that indicates the censoring status of the second equation.  For observations where this variable takes on a value of zero, the actual value is equal to the observed value of y2 (no censoring).  For observations where this variable takes on a value of one, the actual value is above the observed value of y2 (left censoring).  For observations where this variable takes on a value of negative one, the actual value is less than the observed value of y2 (right censoring).The behavior of this routine is undefined if censor1 or censor2 containvalues other than -1, 0, or 1.{title:Examples}{phang}{title:Fixed censoring threshhold}{phang}{cmd:. generate fridge_censor = 0}{phang}{cmd:. replace fridge_censor = -1 if refrigerators == 0}{phang}{cmd:. generate wash_censor = 0}{phang}{cmd:. replace wash_censor = -1 if washing_machines == 0}{phang}{cmd:. bitobit estimate, y1(refrigerators) x1(temperature food_price interest_rate GDP) y2(washing_machines) x2(interest_rate GDP clothes_price dry_cleaning_price) censor1(fridge_censor) censor2(wash_censor)}{phang}{title:Variable censoring threshhold}{phang}{cmd:. bitobit estimate, y1(age_entering_league) x1(height weight family_income) y2(age_leaving_league) x2(height weight family_income) censor1(hasnt_joined_league_to_date) censor2(hasnt_left_league_to_date)}{title:Author}{phang}{browse "http://users.drew.edu/dlawson":Daniel Lawson}, Drew University, dlawson@drew.edu{title:Version}{phang}This is version 0.1 released August 3, 2007.
