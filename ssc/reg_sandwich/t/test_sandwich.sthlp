{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:test_sandwich} is a post-estimation command to be run after {help reg_sandwich}. 
It computes a small-sample corrected Wald test of parameters included in {varlist}, using the same sample and weights as in the {it:reg_sandwich} estimation. The variance-covariance matrix of the parameters is based on on a version of the bias-reduced linearization estimator proposed by Bell and McCaffrey (2002) and further developed by Tipton and Pustejovsky (2015) and Pustejovsky and Tipton (2016). The small sample corrections, termed the "approximate Hotelling's T-squared test" by Pustejovsky and Tipton (2016), involve adjustments to both the Wald test statistic and to the reference distribution. The reference distribution is a multiple of an F distribution with numerator degrees of freedom equal to the number of parameter restrictions and denominator degrees of freedom approximated based on a working model for the variance structure.
