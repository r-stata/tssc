It is based on the addtextprogram printed in the manual [G] gph, p.64; but includes additional syntaxoptions which are passed to -@gph@- commands.Options- -------^align(^#^)^: -1, 0, or 1 for left, center and right-justified.  Default is    left-justified.   see [G] gph text options^rotate(^#^)^: 0 or 1.  0 = text is placed horizontally from left to right                        (default).                    1 = text is placed vertically from bottom to top.^fhgt(^%^)^ font height.  Argument should be integer percentage of default font    height if other than default is desired.  See [G] gph font.^fwdth(^%^)^ font width.  Argument should be integer percentage of default font    width if other than default is desired.  See [G] gph font.^pen(^#^)^ sets the current pen, where # is 0-9. default is 1 (recommended for    text).  See [G] gph pen.Comments- --------^addtxt^ will not work if the current graph was displayed via- -graph using <filename>- or was generated by a program or do-file whichutilized local macros for variable name arguments (eg. -sts graph-).Also see- -------- Manual:  [G] gphOn line:  help for @gph@, @graph@
