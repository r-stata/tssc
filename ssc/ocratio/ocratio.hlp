However, to obtain predictions from the model^ocrpred^ should be used in place of @predict@. To reset problem-size limits, see help @matsize@.Description- -----------^ocratio^ fits models based on continuation-ratio probabilities to ordinal responses (using maximum-likelihood). Three models are available using thelogit, probit and complementary-log-log (f(x)=log[-log(1-x)]) functions.These models are an alternative to the models based on cumulative probabilities fitted by @ologit@ and @oprobit@. ^ocratio^ also enables the fitting of a "ocloglog" model by using the ^cumulative^ option described below. This is possible because the "ocloglog" model is equivalent to thecontinuation-ratio complementary-log-log.^ocrpred^, for use after ^ocratio^, creates newvar containing the index (i.e. xb, see @predict@) or newvarlist containing predicted probabilities for eachresponse category (similarly to @ologitp@).Options for use with ^ocratio^- ----------------------------^test^ requests the calculation of the likelihood-ratio test of whether the	model parameters are constant across the categories of the response	variable.^link(^linkname^)^ specifies the link function. The default is ^link(logit)^ 	unless ^cumulative^ is requested in which case it is ^link(cloglog)^.^eform^ displays the exponentiated coefficients with corresponding standard	errors and confidence intervals as described in ^[R] maximize^. For the	logit link, exponentiation results in odds ratios of continuation-ratio	probabilities; for the cloglog link, exponentiation results in ratios	of discrete hazard functions.^cumulative^ requests the fitting of the continuatio-ratio cloglog model and	the display of the cut-points of the equivalent ordered cloglog model.	^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level in percent, for confidence intervals.	The default is ^level(95)^ or as set by @set level@.Options for use with ^ocrpred^- ----------------------------^xb^ requests the linear predictor xB and one name should be supplied in	newvarlist. This is the default if no options are specified.^prob^ requests the predicted probabilties for each response category. There	should be K names supplied in newvarlist where K is the value of $S_3	(i.e. the number of response categories) from the previous ^ocratio^	command. An easy way of doing this is by using ranges, e.g. if K=8, 	ocrpred p1-p8, prob.Examples- --------	. use auto.dta, clear	. ^xi: ocratio rep78 i.foreign weight, link(probit) level(95)^	. ^ocratio, level(90)^         /* Redisplay results with different CIs */	. ^ocrpred pr1 pr2 pr3 pr4 pr5, prob^   /* Obtain fitted probabilities */	. ologit rep78 weight                 /* Look at ordered logit model */		/* Now fit ordered complementary-log-log model for comparison*/	. ^ocratio rep78 weight, cumul link(clog)^	. tab foreign rep78	. ^xi: ocratio rep78 i.foreign, test^            /* Test coefficients. */					          /* Now put data into 2-way */ 	. gen obs=1                                   /* table of counts to  */ 	. collapse (count) obs, by(rep78 foreign)     /* demonstrate use of  */	. ^xi: ocratio rep78 i.foreign [fweight=obs], test^       /* fweights. */	         /* and look at exponentiated coefficients, ie. odds ratios. */	. ^ocratio, eform^ Saved results- -------------In addition to standard post-estimation results, ^ocratio^ saves inthe global ^S_^# macros:	^S_1^    likelihood-ratio value for test of effect constancy assumption	^S_2^    dof for likelihood-ratio test 	^S_3^    number of distinct response categories (= no. of cut-points +1).Note that S_1 and S_2 are only defined if the ^test^ option is provided.Author- ------Rory Wolfe <wolfer@@cryptic.rch.unimelb.edu.au>, Royal Children's Hospital,	Melbourne, Australia.Also see- --------On-line:  help for @ologit@, @oprobit@, @ologitp@
