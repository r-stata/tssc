In genetics, the test is known as theTransmission/Disequilibrium test (TDT) and is used to test the associationbetween transmitted and non-transmitted parental marker alleles to an affectedchild.Options- -------^notable^ suppresses the output of the contingency table. ^contrib^ reports the contribution of each off-diagonal cell-pair to the    overall symmetry chi-square.^exact^ performs an exact test of table symmetry. CAUTION:  the exact test    requires substantial amounts of time and memory for large tables.Examples- -------- . ^symmetry cases controls^ . ^symmetry cases controls, not^ . ^symmetry cases controls, con^ . ^symmetry cases controls, not con^ . ^symmetry cases controls, ex  con^Author- ------Mario Cleves <mcleves@@stata.com>.Also see- --------On-line:  @epitab@
