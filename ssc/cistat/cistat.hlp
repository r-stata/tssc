.-help for ^cistat^.-Confidence intervals in matrix form-----------------------------------    ^cistat^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [weight]    [ ^, by(^byvarname^) t^otal ci_options ^m^atname^(^matrix_name^)^    tabdisp_options ]    ^cistat^ varlist [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [weight]    [ ^,^ ci_options ^m^atname^(^matrix_name^)^ tabdisp_options ]Description-----------^cistat^ calculates and displays for the groups or variables specifiedthe number of observations, mean, standard error of the mean andconfidence interval for the mean. The results may be stored in a matrixfor further use.Options-------ci_options are options of ^ci^ other than ^by( )^ and ^total^. See help    for @ci@.^by(^byvarname^)^ specifies that calculations are to be performed for    groups defined by byvarname. ^total^ specifies that a calculation is    also to be performed for all observations. Note that ^by( )^ is    allowed only with a single variable and that ^total^ is allowed only    with ^by( )^.tabdisp_options are options of ^tabdisp^. Note that the defaults used    are ^missing format(%9.3f)^.^matname(^matrix_name^)^ saves the matrix produced in the matrix named.    The matrix will have column names ^n^, ^mean^, ^se^, ^llimit^ and    ^ulimit^, except that ^exposure^ will be used instead of ^n^ if the    ^exposure( )^ option is invoked.Examples--------    . ^cistat turn displ gratio, m(ci)^    . ^svmat ci, n(col)^    . ^cistat mpg, by(foreign) total^Author------         Nicholas J.
