"d 'IMPERFECTIV': module to estimate bounds with ""Imperfect Instrumental Variables"" (Nevo and Rosen, 2012)"
d
"d   imperfectiv estimates bounds using ""Imperfect Instrumental"
"d Variables"" (IIV) as    developed by Nevo and Rosen (R.E.Stat,"
d 2012).  This allows for inference based on instrumental
"d variable estimates, however, with weaker assumptions than"
"d instrumental exogeneity.    Namely, the exogeneity assumption of"
d typical IV estimates is replaced with an    assumption about the
d sign of the correlation between the instrument and unobservables. d
d KW: instrumental variables
d KW: bounds
