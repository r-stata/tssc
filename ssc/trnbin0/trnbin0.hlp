Exponential form and C.I. level are allowed as options without reestimation.Use: A 0-truncated negative binomial model is appropriate when modeling count      data which have no possibility of having 0 values. This is to be      distinguished from data sets without 0 values, but which may have 0's.      For example, length of hospital stay data (LOS) begins with patients having     a LOS of 1. 0 values are not allowed. This is a situation where a     truncated model may be appropriate.     Examples- -------- . ^trnbin0 studytim died drug2 drug3, irr nolog^  . ^trnbin0 infected cases cd4 cd8, nolog irr off(cases) cluster(prov)^ . ^trnbin0, level(90)^    [redisplay]Also see- --------Manual:  [5s] poisson, glm, cnregOn-line:  help for @poisson@, @glm@, @cnreg@, @trpois0@.-Joseph HilbeArizona State Universityhilbe@@asu.edu
