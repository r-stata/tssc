d 'SIMULATE2': module enhancing and parallelising simulate
d
d   simulate2 enhances Stataâ€™s built-in simulate command.
d Simulate eases the programming task of performing Monte Carlo
d type simulations. By using frame post rather than postfile
d simulate2 allows programs to return strings (macros) to r() and
d e(). Results can be saved into frames and dtas. simulate2 has
d advanced facilities to save and assign seeds and seed streams to
d individual draws of the program called by simulate2. psimulate2
d parallelises simulate2 and speeds up Monte Carlo type
d simulations. The number of replications are divided into blocks
d and each block is run on a separate instance of Stata.
