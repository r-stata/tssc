If not specified, the first    5 cross-correlations are graphed.^kendall^ | ^pearson^ | ^spearman^ indicates which correlation coefficient    to calculate.  The default is ^pearson^.^noprint^ suppresses printing of the numeric results.^spike^ causes the cross-correlations to be shown as a series of spikes    drawn vertically from zero.^ci^ adds approximate confidence interval bands to the graph at    +/- 2 sqrt(number of data).graph_options refers to any of the options of ^graph, twoway^.Example-------- . ^xcorplot runoff rainfall^Saved results--------------^xcorplot^ saves its results in the macros S_1, ... :         ^S_1^          Correlation between var1 and var2         ^S_2^          p-value of correlation between var1 and var2         ^S_3^          Correlation between L.var1 and var2         ^S_4^          p-value of correlation between L.var1 and var2         ^S_5^          Correlation between var1 and L.var2         ^S_6^          p-value of correlation between var1 and L.var2           .           .           .Authors--------         Nicholas J.
