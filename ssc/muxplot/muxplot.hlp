.-help for ^muxplot^.-Scatter plots with y versus multiple x variables------------------------------------------------    ^muxplot^ yvar xvars [weight] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]    [^,^ graph_options ^l^ink ^n^eed^(^string^)^ ]Description-----------^muxplot^ produces a scatter or twoway plot for one yvar versus two ormore xvars, all of which xvars are measured on comparable scales. Forexample, depth or height may be shown on the vertical axis and two ormore responses on the horizontal axis.Options-------graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^. ^connect^ and^symbol^ refer to the x-axis variables. Note that    1. ^connect(m)^, ^connect(s)^, ^connect(||)^ and ^connect(II)^ are    either unusable or irrelevant.    2. ^sy([_n])^ does not work properly. Instead do something like    ^gen id = _n^    ^muxplot^ ... ^, sy([id]) need(id)^    3. As exemplified above, any variables named in options should also    be specified in the ^need^ option.^link^ connects each set of data points for each observation    (x1, y), (x2, y), (x3, y), ... by a horizontal straight line. For    example, if x is a time axis, x1, x2, x3 might represent times at    which events occurred for an individual. ^link^ may not be combined    with ^connect()^.^need(^string^)^ specifies variables needed by options and not mentioned    before the options. (Otherwise, those variables would be lost by the    ^stack^ included in ^muxplot^.) Two or more variable names should be    separated by spaces.Limitation----------^by( ) link total^ is allowed as a combination of  options but is notguaranteed to produce a correct ^total^ graph, because sorting first onthe ^by( )^ variable may have the side-effect of producing spuriousconnections between data points.Examples-------- . ^muxplot height x1 x2, c(ll)^ . ^muxplot depth x1 x2, c(ll) by(site) n(site) yrev^Author------         Nicholas J.
