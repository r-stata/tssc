{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:indeplist} displays the names of the independent variables of the 
active estimation command. Separate list will be displayed if the 
estimation command contains multiple equations, unless the {cmd:equation} 
option is specified. In that case only lists of independent variables 
from the equations specified in the {cmd:equation} option will be displayed. 
By default the constant and all variables that were droped by Stata (due 
to multicolinearity) are not included in the list. This default can be
overturned by specifying the the {cmd:constant} and/or the {cmd:dropped}
option respectively.

{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt eq:uation(equation list)} Specifies the equations from which the 
independent variables will be displayed. The equation name needs to be 
enclosed by quotation marks if the equation name contains spaces.

{phang}
{opt lo:cal} Specifies that the lists of independent variables are stored 
in locals within the calling program's space. The locals are caled 
X{it:eqname}, where {it:eqname} is the name of the equation with the 
spaces removed. {cmd:indeplist} will now also make a local called 
{it:locnames} that contains the names of the locals made by 
{cmd:indeplist}, except the local {it:locnames} itself. This option is 
primarily useful in combination with {helpb foreach}.

{phang}
{opt cons:tant} Specifies that the constant is also treated as an 
independent variable and returned in the lists of independent variables. If 
this option is not specified the constant (_cons) will be removed from the 
lists of independent variables.

{phang}
{opt drop:ped} Specifies that all variables that were dropped by Stata 
due to multicolinearity are still included in the list of variables.

{title:Saved results}

{phang}
{cmd: r(X}{it:eqname}{cmd:)} Contains the list of independent variables for 
equation {it:eqname}. Spaces are removed from {it:eqname} if the equation 
name constains spaces.
