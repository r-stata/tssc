d 'RANDCOEF': module to estimate correlated random effects and correlated random coefficients models
d
d   randcoef estimates both the CRE (Correlated Random Effects) and
d the CRC (Correlated Random    Coefficients) models allowing
d several weighting matrices for the latter. The command uses the
d number    of dependent variables to know how many years the CRE
d or CRC model contains and use the appropriate    restriction
d matrix.  The command's syntax requires the order of both the
d outcome and choice    variables to be set chronologically.  The
d set up of the CRC model requieres interactions between the
d choice variables. These interactions are automatically created by
d the command.  For a more thorough    overview of the theory
"d behind the estimation, please read Suri (Econometrica, 2011)."
