.-help for ^bgtest^         (STB-55, updated by SSC distribution 11 August 2002).-Calculate the Breusch-Godfrey LM statistic after @regress@ or @newey@-----------------------------------------------------------------	^bgtest^  [, lags(p) force] ^bgtest^ is for use after ^regress^ or ^newey^; see help @regress@ or @newey@.^bgtest^ is for use with time-series data.  You must ^tsset^ your data before using ^bgtest^; see help @tsset@.Description-----------^bgtest^ computes the Breusch (1978)-Godfrey (1978) Lagrange multiplier testfor nonindependence in the error distribution. For a specified number of lags p, the test's null of independent errors has alternatives of either AR(p) orMA(p). The test statistic, a T R^2 measure, is distributed Chi-squared(p)under the null hypothesis. The test is asymptotically equivalent to the Box-Pierce portmanteau test, or Q statistic (@wntestq@), for p lags, but unlike the Q statistic, the Breusch-Godfrey test is valid in the presence of stochastic regressors such as lagged values of the dependent variable. For p=1, the test is asymptotically equivalent to the Durbin-Watson 'h' statistic (@durbinh@), which may be considered a special case of the Breusch-Godfrey test statistic. See Greene (2000), Chapter 13.This version, updated from that published in STB-55, follows the conventionthat lagged values of the estimated residual vector are set to zero, perGreene (2000), so that the auxiliary regression has the same number of degreesof freedom as the regression generating the residuals. The two computationsare asymptotically equivalent and we know their distribution under the nullonly asymptotically. In small samples, this convention will prevent the lossof degrees of freedom experienced under the former version of the test.The command displays the test statistic, degrees of freedom and P-value,and places values in the return array. @return list@ for details. Options-------The ^lags^ option specifies p, the number of lags to be included in the auxiliaryregression. It must be less than 25% of the sample size.The ^force^ option specifies that the test is to be allowed after @regress ..., robust@ and @newey@; by default it is not allowed.  Inthese cases the test statistic is exactly the same as if standard OLS wereperformed using @regress@.  This is true because the test is based on theresiduals from the regression and they are the same for @regress@,@regress ..., robust@, and @newey@.  There is no way the test canutilize any of the information used to make the standard errors robust afterestimation with @newey@ or @regress ..., robust@.  It is best to viewthe test as a test of the OLS disturbances whether estimation is by@regress@, @regress ..., robust@, or @newey@.Examples--------	. ^use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/macro/wgmacro.dta^	. ^regress  consumption L(1/4).income^	. ^bgtest, lags(4)^	. ^g Lincome = L.income^	. ^newey  consumption Lincome, lag(4)^	. ^bgtest, lags(4) force^References----------Breusch, T.
