Data are assumed to be paired, but ^unpaired^ changes this assumption.In the third form, ^cid^ gives a CI for the mean difference across the two groupsdefined by groupvar.  Data are assumed paired, but ^unpaired^ reverses this.Options- -------^median^ calculates CI's as above, except for medians rather than for means.    CI's are determined by rank-based methods as described in Gardner and    Altman's (1989) book "Statistics with Confidence", pp. 74-79.  A normal    approximation with a continuity correction of 0.5 is used, rather than    tables of exact values.  The accuracy should be adequate when both groups    have at least 5 observations.    Note that the CI for a single median is obtained using a method different    from that used by the @centile@ command, so will not be identical.    WARNING: calculation of CIs for unpaired medians requires storage space for    n1 * n2 observations, where n1 and n2 are the numbers in each group.  If    you have insufficient memory, you will get an error message and a ^r(2002);^    return code.^unpaired^ indicates that the data are to be treated as unpaired.^unequal^ indicates that the unpaired data are not to be assumed to have equal    variances.^level(^#^)^ defines the percent coverage for the confidence interval.Examples- -------- . ^cid bp2 bp1^ . ^cid bp2 bp1, median^ . ^cid bp2 bp1, median unpaired^ . ^cid bp, by(treatmnt)^ . ^cid bp, by(treatmnt) median^ . ^cid bp, by(treatmnt) unpaired^ . ^cid bp, by(treatmnt) unpaired unequal^Stored- ------	^$S_1^	number of observations	^$S_2^	degrees of freedom (not used if ^median^ is specified)	^$S_3^	mean or median difference, group 1 - group 2	^$S_4^	SEM, or K if ^median^ specified (see Gardner and Altman)	^$S_5^	lower confidence limit for difference	^$S_6^	upper confidence limit for differenceAlso see- -------- Manual:  [R] @ci@, @centile@, @ttest@, @ranksum@, @signrank@.
