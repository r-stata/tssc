{bf:pcdid} {hline 2} Principal components difference-in-differences


{title:Description}

{pstd}
{bf:pcdid} implements factor-augmented difference-in-differences (DID) estimation. It is useful in situations where the user suspects that trends may be unparallel and/or stochastic among control and treated units. 
The data structure is similar to that in a DID setup. The estimation method is regression-based and can be considered as an extension of conventional DID regressions. 
{p_end}

{pstd}
{bf:pcdid} also implements a parallel trend alpha test (based on an interactive effects structure) and a recursive procedure that determines the number of factors automatically.
{p_end}

{title:Quick start}

{pstd}
Consider the following list of variables in a long-form panel data set:

{synopthdr:variable}
{synoptline}
{synoptset 20 tabbed}{...}
{synopt:{opt id}}     unit identifier {p_end }
{synopt:{opt time}}   time variable {p_end }
{synopt:{opt y}}      dependent variable {p_end }
{synopt:{opt treated}} =1 for treated units; =0 for control (never-treated) units {p_end }
{synopt:{opt treated_post}} =1 for all observations from treated units after policy intervention; =0 otherwise {p_end }
{synopt:{opt x1, x2, ...}} other covariates {p_end }
{synoptline}
{p2colreset}{...}

{pstd}You must declare your data as panel data before using {cmd:pcdid}: {p_end}
{phang2} {cmd: xtset id time} {p_end}

{pstd} PCDID model with the number of factors determined automatically: {p_end}
{phang2} {cmd: pcdid y treated treated_post x1 x2} {p_end}

{pstd}Create {bf:yhat} containing the prediction from the previous {cmd:pcdid} command: {p_end}
{phang2} {cmd: pdd yhat} {p_end}

{pstd}Create {bf:yhat0} containing the counterfactual outcomes: {p_end}
{phang2} {cmd: replace treated_post=0} {p_end}
{phang2} {cmd: pdd yhat0} {p_end}

{title:Remarks and Examples}

{pstd} {cmd:pcdid} first uses a data-driven method (based on principal component analysis) on the control panel to compute factor proxies, which capture the unobserved trends. 
Then, among treated unit(s), it runs regression(s) using the factor proxies as extra covariates. 
Analogous to a control function approach, these extra covariates capture the endogeneity arising from potentially unparallel trends. {p_end}

{pstd}{cmd:pcdid} also allows for inclusion of other observed time-varying covariates. (Time-invariant covariates are subsumed by fixed effects.) 
{cmd:pcdid} is robust to the specification of trends, e.g., it encompasses nonstationary trends. {p_end}

{pstd} When there are multiple treated units in the data, {cmd:pcdid} computes the mean-group (PCDID-MG) estimator for the treated units. 
This estimator targets the ATET casual parameter. Standard errors are obtained from a nonparametric mean-group variance formula. {p_end}

{pstd} When there is only one treated unit in the data, {cmd:pcdid} computes a basic (PCDID-basic) estimator for that treated unit. 
This estimator targets the ITET casual parameter. Standard errors are obtained from the Newey-West variance formula. {p_end}

{pstd} For more details about the properties of these estimators, their target causal parameters, and the parallel trend alpha test, 
see {help pcdid##ck:Chan and Kwok (2016, 2020)} in the reference list. The paper also contains a recursive procedure to factor extraction, adapted from Ahn and Horenstein (2013)â€™s growth-ratio (GR) test. {p_end}

{pstd}{ul: Additional example 1:} {p_end}

{pstd} The following command implements pcdid estimation with 3 factor proxies and performs the parallel trend alpha test. {p_end}

{phang2} {cmd: pcdid y treated treated_post x1 x2, alpha fp(3)} {p_end}


{pstd}{ul: Additional example 2:} {p_end}

{pstd} We can have more than one treatment variable. For example, suppose {bf:treated_post2} =1 for all observations from treated units that are at least 3 periods after policy intervention, =0 otherwise. {p_end}

{pstd} The following command captures a step function of treatment effects over time. {p_end}

{phang2} {cmd: pcdid y treated treated_post treated_post2 x1 x2} {p_end}


{pstd}{ul: Additional example 3:} {p_end}

{pstd}Suppose {bf:id==1} is a treated unit. The following command implements pcdid-basic estimation on this treated unit, using a NW lag order of 3:{p_end}

{phang2} {cmd: gen resid = y - yhat} {p_end}

{phang2} {cmd: replace treated_post = 0} {p_end}
{phang2} {cmd: pdd yhat0} {p_end}

{pstd}Generate counterfactual outcomes assuming no treatment and {bf:x1=1}:{p_end}

{phang2} {cmd: replace treated_post = 0} {p_end}
{phang2} {cmd: replace x1 = 1} {p_end}
{phang2} {cmd: pdd yhat01} {p_end}

{pstd}Then plot the outcomes for {bf:id==1}:{p_end}

{phang2} {cmd: line y yhat yhat0 yhat01 time if id==1} {p_end}


{title:Stored results}

{p 8 8 8}

{pstd} This is version 1.0 of the program (date: Feb 09, 2021). {p_end}

{pstd}The following are required to run the program: {p_end}
{phang2} . Stata 14.0 or higher by default, although users may modify the {help version} line in the ado file such that it can be run under an earlier version of Stata {p_end}
{phang2} . The data must be recognized as panel data by Stata with the command {help xtset} {p_end}

{pstd}In the PCDID-basic estimator (one treated unit), the command uses the {help newey} package to estimate the variance matrix. It may be sensitive to issues inherent to the {help newey} command.{p_end}
