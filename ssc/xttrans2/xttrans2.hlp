Description
-----------

If you have not read help for @xt@, please do so now.

^xttab^, a generalization of @tabulate@, performs one-way tabulations and decom-
poses counts into between and within components in cross-sectional time-series
(xt) data. ^xttab^ is part of official Stata and untouched by the author. 

^xttrans2^, another generalization of @tabulate@, reports transition probabilities
(the change in a single categorical variable over time). It differs from 
official Stata's ^xttrans^ only in detail: (a) options of ^tabulate^ other 
than ^row^ and ^freq^ also may be specified; (b) a matrix of probabilities may 
be saved; (c) it may not be called ^by^ varlist. 


Options
-------

^i(^varname^)^ specifies the variable name corresponding to i; see help @xt@.

^t(^varname^)^ specifies the variable name corresponding to t; see help @xt@.

^freq^, allowed with ^xttrans2^ only, specifies that frequencies as well as transi-
    tion probabilities are to be displayed.

^prob^ specifies that the matrix produced contain probabilities rather than 
    frequencies. 

tabulate_options are options of ^tabulate^ other than ^row^ and ^freq^. For 
    example, it may be useful to use ^matcell^ to save the frequencies to 
    a matrix. 


Examples
--------

	. ^iis id^
	. ^tis year^

	. ^xttab race^
	. ^xttab married^

	. ^xttrans2 married, matcell(T)^
