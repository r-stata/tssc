..-help for ^markov^..-Markov chain analysis---------------------    ^markov^ varname [ , ^f^name^(^string^)^ ^p^name^(^string^)^    tabchi_options ]Description-----------^markov^ examines varname, treated as a sequence or series, to producebasic summaries relevant to discrete-time, discrete-state Markov chains.^markov^ tabulates one-step transition frequencies from one state toanother, carries out a chi-square test for independence, and tabulates atransition probability matrix. The frequency matrix and the probabilitymatrix are saved as F and P, or as whatever names are specified.Matrices with these names are overwritten.It is the user's responsibility to ensure that data are in theappropriate sort order when ^markov^ is called.^tabchi^ must be installed first.Options-------^fname(^string^)^ specifies a name for the frequency matrix (default F).^pname(^string^)^ specifies a name for the probability matrix (default P).tabchi_options are options allowed with ^tabchi^.Example-------    . ^markov state^Author------         Nicholas J.
