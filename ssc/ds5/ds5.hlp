.-help for ^ds5^.-Describe variables in memory (variant for Stata 5.0)----------------------------------------------------    ^ds5^ [varlist] [ , { ^n^umeric ^s^tring | ^t^ype^(^vartype^)^ }    { ^h^asval^(a^|^y^|^u^|^n)^ | ^w^ithval^(^value_label_name^)^ } ^d^etail ]Description-----------^ds5^ lists variable names in a compact format (or optionally, in thesame format as ^describe^). It is a variant on ^ds^.Options-------^numeric^ specifies that only numeric variables should be listed.^string^ specifies that only string variables should be listed.^type(^vartype^)^ specifies that only variables of type vartype should    be listed. ^type( )^ may be abbreviated down to as few as one    character for ^b^yte, ^i^nt, ^l^ong, ^f^loat and ^d^ouble. ^string^    or any abbreviation of it means string variables of any length, so    that ^type(str)^ is equivalent to ^string^. ^type( )^ may not be    combined with ^numeric^ or ^string^.^hasval(a^|^y^|^u^|^n)^ specifies that variables with or without    value labels attached should be listed. ^hasval(a)^ or ^hasval(y)^    means attached and ^hasval(u)^ or ^hasval(n)^ means unattached. The    variables listed will be a subset of those otherwise specified.    ^t(int) v(a)^ means int variables with value labels attached.^withval(^value_label_name^)^ specifies that variables with value label    value_label_name attached should be listed. The variables listed    will be a subset of those otherwise specified.^detail^ specifies that a more detailed listing should be given.    ^ds5, s d^ is equivalent to ^describe^ with all the string    variables.    ^ds5, n d^ is equivalent to ^describe^ with all the numeric    variables.Saved results-------------^ds5^ saves in global ^vlist^ the names of the variables listed.Examples--------    . ^ds5, s^    . ^ds5, s d^    . ^ds5, n^    . ^order $vlist^    . ^ds5, n^    . ^su $vlist^    . ^ds5, s^    . ^edit $vlist^    . ^ds5, t(float)^    . ^ds5, t(str16)^    . ^ds5, w(origin)^Author------         Nicholas J.
