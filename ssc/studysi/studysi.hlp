An arbitrary number K (>=2) groups.2. Global or linear trend tests with arbitrary dose levels.3. Logrank (unweighted or weighted (Tarone-Ware or Harrington-Fleming with   any index)) and binomial (conditonal and unconditional) tests.4. Time dependent rates of event, loss to follow-up and withdrawal from    allocated treatment (treatment change).5. Staggered entrymethod: The method of comparison with the format		l|t|h [I]|b [c|u]	where	l = unweighted logrank (default test)	t = Tarone-Ware test (logrank with weights proportional to the square 	    root of the total number at risk at event times.	h = Harrington-Fleming (logrank with weights proportional to S**I,            where S is the estimated pooled survival function at event times.	I = Index for Harrington-Fleming weights. Default is I=1.	b = Binomial test comparing the proportion of failure at the end of	    the study.	c = Binomial test is conditional on the total number of observed events	    using Peto's approximation to the log odds ratio (default).	u = Uncoditional binomial test.Options-------^alpha^  specifies the significance level. The default is ^alpha(0.05)^.^aratio^ specifies the allocation ratio. ^aratio(^#1 #2...#r^)^ means that allocation       ratio for group k is #k, k=1,...r. If r<^ngroups^, the allocation ratio       for group k is #r, k=r+1,...,^ngroups^. The default is equal group size.^crover^ (Only when wg is specified) is the target group number when crossing       over. ^crover(^#1 #2...#r^)^ means that the kth group withdrawing from       allocated treatment (specified by ^wg^) crosses over to recieve the       allocated treatment of group #k, k=1,...r. The default is that when       individuals in group 1 change treatment, they receive the treatment       assigned to those in group 2. Individuals in group k (k > 1) crossover       to recieve the treatment assined to group 1.^detail^ requests more detailed output including expected proportion of failure,       withdrawal from allocated treatment and loss to follow-up by the end       of the study.^dose^ specifies doses for dose-respone (linear trend) test. ^dose(^#1 #2...#r^)^       assigns dose for	groups 1,...,r. If r < ngroups, #r is taken as the       dose for groups r+1,...ngroups. The default is dose(1 2...ngroups) which       is only used when ^trend^ is specified but not ^dose^.^edf0^ is required and gives the Control event distribution function. This need       not be one of the distributions to be compared unless hratio = 1 for       some of the groups. The format is ^edf0(^elist0^)^, where string "elist0"       is "#1 [#2 ...#r^,^#1 #2 ...#r]". Thus, ^edf0(^p1 p2 ...pr^,^t1 t2 ...tr^)^       gives the value pi for the cumulative distribution function for the       event time at the end of time period ti, i=1,...,r. Instantaneous event       rates are assumed constant within time periods ( time-to-event is       piecewise exponential). If r < ^nperiod^, the instantaneous event rates in       periods r+1,...,nperiod are taken to be the same as in period r. If only       one value of ^edf0^ is specified, this is taken to be the value at the end       of the study and the instantaneous event rate is constant thoughout       follow-up. Thus if the number of periods ^nperiod = 6^ then ^edf0(0.5)^ is       equivalent to ^edf0(0.5,6)^ and gives 50% cumulative failure at the end       of period ^nperiod^ and an exponential distribution for the control       failure time. ^edf0(0.2 0.4,1 5)^ gives expected cumulative proportions       of failure ^0.2^ at the end of the first period and ^0.4^ at the end of the       fifth period. The instantaneous event rate during the first period is       ^-log(1-0.2)=0.223^. The instantaneous event rate during periods 2,3,4 and       5 is ^-log((1-0.4)/(1-0.2))/4 = 0.072^ which is also the default rate       during period 6. This gives cumulative failure probability of 0.55 at       the end of period 6.^hratio^ is required and specifies the event hazard ratio functions. The format         is ^hratio(^hrlist^)^, where the string "hrlist" is         "#1_1 [#1_2 ...#1_r1]^,^#2_1 [#2_2 ...#2_r2]^,^...^,^ #k_1 [#k_2 ...#k_rk]".         The event hazard ratio of group i (relative to the control         distribution edf0) is #i_j during period j, j=1,...ri; i=1,...k, If         ri < ^nperiod^ then the hazard ratio function during periods ri+1,...        ^nperiod^ is assumed to be #i_ri. If k < ^ngroups^, the hazard ratio         functions for groups k+1,...,ngroups are assumed equal to the         geometric mean of the hazard ratio functions for groups 1,...k.^ldf^  is required when lg, groups with loss to follow-up, is specified. ^ldf^       specifies the distribution function of time to loss-to-follow-up. The       format is ^ld^f^(^llist [^;^llist^;^... llist]^)^, where each llist specifies       a cumulative distribution function for time to to loss from follow-up,       one for each group specified by ^lg^ and in the same order. Each llist has       the same form and interpretation as a distribution function as elist0 in      ^edf0^. e. g. if ^nperiod^ = 6, then ^lg(1 3) ldf(0.2;.05 0.15,2 5)^       specifies that:	 (i)   Groups 1 and 3 are subject to loss to follow-up.	 (ii)  The cumulative probability of loss to follow-up is .2 by the end	       of the last period in group1, .05 at the end of the period 2 and	       .15 at the end of period 5 in group 3.	 (iii) Individuals in the other groups are not subject to loss to	       follow-up.^lg^  specifies the groups subject to loss to follow-up. ^ldf^ must then be      specified giving the cumulative distribution functions of time to loss-      to-follow-up in the same order.^local^ specifies local alternative for the unconditional binomial test of the       null hypothesis of equal proportions. The default is ^nolocal^ if method       is b u. ^n^ specifies that total sample size is calculated if ^n^ = 0. Otherwise power    is calculated given total sample size = ^n^. The default is ^n = 0^.^ngroup^ specifies the number of comparitive groups. The default is ^ngroups^ = 2.^nperiod^ is the number of time periods within which all instantaneous rates are          constant. The default is ^nperiod = 1^.^power^ specifies the study power. the default is power = 0.8 if ^n > 0^.^pwehr^ specifies the hazard ratio function post withdrawal from allocated        treatment. The format is ^pw^ehr^(^hrlist^)^, where hrlist gives the hazard        ratio functions (relative to the control event time distribution) after        treatment change for the groups specified by ^wg^ and in the same order.        The format and interpretation of hrlist is the same as that of ^hratio^        except that the hazard ratio functions for the remaining groups,        subject to treatment change (given in ^wg^) but not assigned to a hazard        ratio function by ^pwehr^, is taken to be the same as the last hazard        ratio function specified by ^pwehr^. When both ^pwehr^ and ^crover^ are        specified, ^crover^ is ignored.^recrt^ specifies the duration and rate of recruitment. If ^recrt^ is not        specified, recruitment is assumed completed at the begining of the        study. i.e. duration of recruitment = 0. When ^recrt^ is specified, its        format is ^recrt(^[duration [recrpr0]]^,^[w1 w2...wk]^,^[s1 s2...sk]^)^;        where            duration = the number of periods for the completion of recruitment.                       The default is duration = ^nperiods^.            recrpr0 = the proportion recruited (instantaneously) at the start                      of the study. The default is recrpr0 = 0.            w1...wk are the relative proportions recruited in periods 1 to k.                    The default specifies equal proportions.            s1...sm specify the shape of recruitment time distribution within                    periods. si = 0 for uniform entry during period i, and                    si = L>0 for negative exponential with rate L. The default                    is uniform entry time within each period.^wdf^  is required when wg, groups with treatment change (withdrawal from        allocated treatment), is specified. ^wdf^ specifies the distribution       function of time to withdrawal. The format is the same as that of ^ldf^.^wg^  specifies the groups subject to loss to follow-up. ^wdf^ must then be      specified giving the cumulative distribution functions of time to       withdrawal from allocated treatment in the same order.Examples--------	. ^studysi l, edf0(0.5) hr(1,0.75) np(3)^           (compares two exponential distributions using the logrank test)	. ^studysi h, edf0(0.5) hr(1,0.75,0.5) np(3) ng(3) recrt(2,,)^	. ^studysi l, edf0(0.5) hr(1,0.75,0.5) np(3) ng(3) recrt(2,,) tr^	. ^studysi , edf0(0.2 0.5,1 3) hr(1,0.6 0.6 0.75) np(3)^           (treatment effect changes over time)	. ^studysi l, edf0(0.5) hr(1,0.75) np(3) lg(1 2) ldf(.1;.1)^           (10% lost to follow-up by end of study)	. ^studysi l, edf0(0.5) hr(1,0.75) np(3) lg(1 2) ldf(.1;.1) /*^                ^*/ wg(1 2) wdf(.3;.1)^           (30% of group 1 and 10% og group 2 crossover by end of study)Also see-------- Manual:  ^[R] sampsi^
