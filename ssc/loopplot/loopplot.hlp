This is achieved by temporarily appending one or moreextra observations to the data set that copy the first relevant non-missingobservation for each loop.Options- -------graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^, including ^by()^.^sort^ is allowed but ignored.Remarks- -------There are some known side-effects of appending extra observations:    ^sy([_n])^ is marred by overwriting of ^_n^ for the first    observation and its copy. The correct effect can be achieved by    . ^gen id = _n^    . ^loopplot y x, c(l) sy([id])^    There are various small or large effects on other ^connect^ options.Suppose there are several variables to be plotted on the y axis. Eachvariable should define just one loop. (If any variable specifies morethan one loop, there would be spurious connections between them.)Suppose we have four loops defined by    ^y1^ and ^x1^    ^y2^ and ^x2^    ^y3^ and ^x3^    ^y4^ and ^x4^then to meet the Stata rule that only one variable can be plotted on thex axis it is necessary to pack the four x variables into one. Asatisfactory data structure to start with is     ^y1   .   .   .        x1^      ^.  y2   .   .        x2^      ^.   .  y3   .        x3^      ^.   .   .  y4        x4^stacked into     ^Y1  Y2  Y3  Y4        X^Here the ^.^ represent blocks of missing values. This data structurecould be produced by using ^stack^, or by direct entry of the data.Examples- -------- . ^loopplot rain temp, c(l)^ . ^loopplot rain temp, c(l) by(station)^Author- ------         Nicholas J.
