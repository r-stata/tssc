{phang}{opt stubs(char stubs)} says what {help chchar##stubs:stubs}
should be checked for dependencies. If omitted, this uses the
{cmd:valid} stub, checking for `like' dependencies in the
{bf:valid_check} {help char:characteristic}, and for variables needed
in the {bf:valid_other_vars_needed} {help char:characteristic}.
If multiple stubs are given, then all dependencies from the above two
suffixes are used.
