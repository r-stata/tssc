d 'VC_PACK': module for the estimation of smooth varying coefficient models
d
d   Nonparametric regressions are powerful statistical tools to
d model relationships between dependent and independent variables
d with minimal assumptions on the underlying functional forms.
"d However, the added flexibility creates a curse of dimensionality,"
d an induces a high computational cost in samples with even
"d moderate sizes. As an alternative, semiparametric models that"
d combine the flexibility of nonparametric regressions with the
d structure of standard models. VC_pack provides commands for the
d estimation of smooth varying-coefficient model (Hastie and
"d Tibshirani, 1993, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society,"
"d Series B 55: 757â€“796), based on kernel regression methods,"
d using a new set of commands within that aim to facilitate
d bandwidth selection and model estimation as well as create
d visualizations of the results.
