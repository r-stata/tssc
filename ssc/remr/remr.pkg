d 'REMR': module to implement robust error meta-regression method for doseâ€“response meta-analysis
d
d  remr performs dose-response meta-analysis using inverse variance
d weighted least squares (WLS) regression with cluster robust error
d variances.  This approach is a special case of the one-stage
d generalised least squares for trend approach where the covariance
d need not be imputed from the data.  This method allows the model
d to include a non-zero intercept to absorb any bias that is not
d accounted for by the terms in the model but notably the intercept
d now becomes a coefficient rather than a constant given the use of
"d WLS.  Weights for the reference doses are imputed, these are"
d equal to the maximum of the within study weights based on the
d inverse of the variance of the effect sizes in the study.  This
d minimises the possible deviation of the regression intercept from
d the origin without having to force the regression model through
d the origin.  This method does not require knowledge of the
"d correlation structure of the data within a study, because it"
d stacks included effects as a cluster by study and uses the
"d cluster-robust analysis to obtain a robust standard error, thus"
d treating observations as independent across clusters but
d correlated within each cluster.
