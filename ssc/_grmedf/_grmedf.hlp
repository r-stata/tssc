     ^egen^ [newvartype] newvarname ^= rmedf(^varlist^)^ [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]


 Description
 -----------

^egen rmedf^ (via _grmedf.ado file) generates median (across the
row, i.e. within the current observation) of varlist, missing values
ignored. It essentially reshapes the data (and thus might require a
lot of memory), unlike Nick J. Cox's @_grmed@ that constructs the 
median within the existing data file and requires much less memory.
The latter however produces the resulting variable observation by
observation and is thus rather slow.
