{hi:soepdo} {hline 2} Retrieval of SOEP drop-outs made easy



{title:Syntax}

{pstd}
{opt soepdo} [{opt namelist}] , {opt s:oepdir()} {opt y:perg()} [{opt e:rhebj()}]



{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:soepdo} is intended for people who need to build datasets which contain
 drop-outs from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP Group, 2001). In the
 current version only the retrieval of variables in {it:YPBRUTTO} is supported.

{pstd}
Where appropriate the options are named as the variables in
{it:YPBRUTTO} which are
 used as criterium for inclusion of observation in your dataset.



{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt namelist} is optional. One may specify variables from {it:YPBRUTTO} here which are than included in the new dataset. If no variables are given, all variables from 
  {it:YPBRUTTO} are included. PERSNR, ERHEBJ and YPERG are always included.

{phang}
{opt s:oepdir} is mandatory. It tells {cmd:soepdo} the path to the directory
 where SOEP files are stored.

{phang}
{opt y:perg} is manadatory. Here one specifies the reasons for drop-outs in 
 terms of YPERG (see Frick and Haisken-DeNew, 2005). If no integer is given,
 no observations will be in your dataset.

{phang}
{opt e:rhebj} is optional. Some drop-outs can occur multiple times per person,
 e.g. moving abroad. By default, {cmd:soepdo} will keep all observations but
 one may specify {opt e(last)} or {opt e(first)} to keep only the first or the
 last drop-out in terms of ERHEBJ.
