d 'EBCT': module to perform entropy reweighting to create balanced samples for continuous treatments
d
d  ebct estimates Entropy Balancing weights for continuous
d treatments. The routine minimizes the deviation of weights from
d uniform or user-specified base weights while adhering to
d balancing constraints. Estimated weights retain means of
d covariates and the treatment variable while removing Pearson
d correlations between covariates and the treatment. Resulting
d weights can be used for the estimation of dose-response
d functions.
