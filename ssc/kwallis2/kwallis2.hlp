The null hypothesis is that k samplescome from the same population or from identical populations with the samemedian. When a significant value is found, ^kwallis2^ determine which groups aredifferent.varname refers to the variable recording the outcome and groupvar refers to thevariable denoting the population.  Note that the ^by()^ "option" is not optional.With the ^control()^ option, you may specify which group is to be considered asa control group or a standard group. For example, when a researcher wishes toassess the effects of various drugs on behavior.Example-------. ^kwallis2 medage, by(region)^. ^kwallis2 behavior, by(drug) control(1)^Also see-------- Manual:  ^[R] kwallis^On-line:  help for @nptrend@, @oneway@, @runtest@, @signrank@Book:     Siegel S. & Castellan J.          "Nonparametric Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences"          Chap. 8 (1988) McGraw-Hill
