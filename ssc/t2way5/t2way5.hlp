.-help for ^t2way5^.-Tukey's Two-Way Analysis by Medians-----------------------------------   ^t2way5^ rowvar colvar, ^s^ummari^(^depvar^)^ [ ^gr^aph ^q^uietly      ^gen(^rowfit colfit grandfit^)^ graph_options ]Description-----------^t2way5^ uses Tukey's low-median polish technique to fit a two-way tableby medians.^t2way5^ can produce both a tabular report and a graph.  Withoutoptions, it produces only the tabular report.graph_options are those options allowed with ^graph, twoway^, apart    from ^symbol^, ^ttick^, ^rtick^, ^xlabel^ and ^ylabel^.Remarks-------^t2way5^ is a translation to Stata 5.0 syntax and conventions of^t2way^, issued on a Stata Support Disk in November 1990. It includessome minor bug fixes and style changes. Stata Corp bear noresponsibility for this program.Options-------^summari()^ indicates the dependent variable and is a required option.^graph^ produces a residual graph showing the size and sign of the    residuals plotted with an indication of the difference between the    row and column fits on the horizontal axis and the fitted value on    the vertical axis.^quietly^ suppresses the tabular report.  This is typically used in    combination with ^graph^ to obtain only the graph.^gen( )^ adds three new variables to your data:  the row fit, column    fit, and grand median fit.  This option resorts your data.Example-------        ^. t2way5 county year, s(Demvote)^Author------         Nicholas J. Cox, University of Durham, U.K.         n.j.cox@@durham.ac.uk
