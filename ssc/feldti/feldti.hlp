CACI, September 1999 (v1.0).-Comparison of two independent coefficients of reliability---------------------------------------------------------     ^feldti^ rel1 rel2, N1() n2() K1() k2()Description-----------The reliabilities of two tests (^rel1^ & ^rel2^) are compared betweentwo samples of ^n1^ & ^n2^ subjects. The tests are ^k1^ and ^k2^ itemslong respectively.The independence of the samples is assumed.If ^n2^ is not specified, the samples are supposed to be of equal sizes.If ^k2^ is not specified, the tests are supposed to be of equal lengths.Reference---------Feldt L.S.
