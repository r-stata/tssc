d 'IVBOUNDS': module providing instrumental variable method to bound treatment-effects estimates with potentially misreported and endogenous program participation
d
d   ivbounds provides an estimate of the bounds of the average
"d causal effect for compliers (Imbens and Angrist, 1994)    when"
d both noncompliance and misreporting of treatment status are
d present.  The approach follows the estimation    procedure
d developed in Tommasi and Zhang (2020).  When iv(varname_iv) is
"d binary, the command estimates the bounds    of the local average"
d treatment effect (LATE).  When iv(varname_iv) is binary and
"d covariates are included, the    command estimates the bounds of"
"d the unconditional LATE (Fr√∂lich, 2007).  In both cases, the"
d estimated bounds    coincide with those in Ura (2018).  When
"d iv(varname_iv) is discrete, the command estimates the bounds of"
d the    weighted average of LATEs (WLATE).  When iv(varname_iv) is
"d discrete and covariates are included, the command    estimates"
"d the bounds of the conditional WLATE.  In the latter case, the"
d user must specify the number of strata to    discretise the
d propensity score. The inference procedure follows Dehejia and
d Wahba (1999) and Battistin and    Sianesi (2011).  ivbounds
"d assumes a binary treat(varname_t), a binary or discrete"
"d iv(varname_iv), and a continuous    or discrete depvar.  The"
d bounds can be improved if external information regarding the
d treatment misclassification    probability in treat(varname_t) is
d available.
