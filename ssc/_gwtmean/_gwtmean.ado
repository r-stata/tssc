/*_gwtmean.ado  6-5-2001David Kantor, Institute for Policy StudiesJohns Hopkins UniversityThis is an egen weighted mean function, based on c:\stata\ado\_\_gmean.adoActually, it is just a very minor tweaking of _gmean.In fact this could be considered an enhancement to _gmean; just rename thisfile to _gmean and adjust the program define statement.This is used with egen as follows: egen newvar = wtmean(exp), by(byvar) weight(wgt_expr)This allows a weight option.  egen does not allow a weight in the usualmanner ([weight= wgtvar]), so we us an option.  If the weight option isomitted, then the action and results are identical to egen mean(_gmean.ado).  (If the weight expression is a non-zero constant, then, too,the results are identical to egen mean.)The weight macro captures the weight.  If it is non-empty, thenit is changed to include parentheses and the * operator.  The inclusionof parentheses actually allows an expression -- not just a variable.*/*! version 1.0.0  6-5-2001program define _gwtmean	version 3.0	local varlist "req new max(1)"	local exp "req nopre"	local if "opt"	local in "opt"	local options "by(string) weight(string)"	parse "`*'"	tempvar touse 	if "`weight'" ~= "" {		local weight "* (`weight')"	}	quietly {		gen byte `touse'=1 `if' `in'		sort `touse' `by'		by `touse' `by': replace `varlist' = /*			*/ sum((`exp')`weight')/sum(((`exp')!=.)`weight') if `touse'==1		by `touse' `by': replace `varlist' = `varlist'[_N]	}end
