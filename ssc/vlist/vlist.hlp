Moore).-Unabbreviate variable list programming command----------------------------------------------      ^vlist^ varlistDescription-----------^vlist^ expands and unabbreviates a varlist of either all new or all existingvariables; see ^[U] 18.4 varlists^.  The result is returned in the global macro^S_1^.  The number of variables is returned in the global macro ^S_2^.  This isa more general command than Stata's @unabbrev@, since it can expand a list ofnew variables.  Also, unlike Stata's @parse@, ^vlist^ knows how to expandvarlists with embedded numbers, such as, v1_1-v1_4.  Finally, when used with@array@, ^vlist^ can expand varlists containing array references; see helpfor @array@.Example------- . vlist v1-v4 . vlist x1v1-x1v4 . vlist varray{1,1} - varray{1,5}The last example assumes varray has been previously defined as a twodimensional variable array, with at least one row and five columns.Author------   David E.
