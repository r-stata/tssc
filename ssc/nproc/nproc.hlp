If more than 2 curves are requested, a chi-square testfor the difference between the first and subsequent curves is calculated.The default graph option displays the graph of each variable as the statistics are being calculated. In addition, the default graph optionsaves sensitivity and specificity data, AUCs, standard errors, and Chi-square and p-value data to an output file for subsequent analysisby the companion graph program, ^rocgraph^. While graphs are beingdisplayed by ^nproc^ and statistics calculated, graphs may be selectedand printed. ^rocgraph^ also displays summary statistics.ROC analysis is a method of measuring and comparing the accuracy of one ormore variables at predicting whether each observation is a member of one oftwo groups/categories.  The ROC curve plots the Sensitivity (True Positiverate) against 1-Specificity (False Positive rate).  The larger the AreaUnder the ROC Curve(AUC) , the better the variable is at predicting groupmembership.  This command uses the methodology of DeLong (1988) and Bamber(1975).  The AUC of the empirical ROC curve is equivalent to theMann-Whitney two-sample U-statistic.  Therefore the Standard Error of an AUCand the covariance between two correlated AUCs can be calculated using theSE and covariances of the Mann-Whitney U-statistics for the variable beinganalysed.  A Chi-square test is then used to test if two AUCs aresignificantly different.  If the p-value of the Chi-square statistic issmall then conclude that the AUCs are significantly different.  Thesemethods do not require any distributional assumptions or numericalconstraints on any of the variables.Options-------^by^(varname) is required. It is the grouping variable, It canbe coded either as 0/1 or 1/2.^file^(filename) is the file to which the sensitivity/specificity dataand summary statistics will be saved. The file is saved as filename.dta. You will usually want to enable this option becauseit allows manipulation of the data and graphs. If ^nograph^ is selected^file^(filename) will be ignored.^nog^raph stops the displaying of graphs and saving of data.^pause^ turns on Stata's -more- command.Examples---------nproc mpg weight hd turn price,by(foreign) file(autoroc) pause-           Nonparametric Receiver Operating Curves (ROC)Grouping variable: foreign Positives 22  negatives 52The AUC of the empirical ROC curve for  mpg =.73The Standard Error of the AUC=.065                   Grouping variable: foreign Positives 22  negatives 52 The AUC of the empirical ROC curve for  weight =.88  The Standard Error of the AUC=.04                            Chisq statistic for the difference in AUCs = 6.13, p=.013             Grouping variable: foreignPositives 22  negatives 52The AUC of the empirical ROC curve for  hdroom =.69 The Standard Error of the AUC=.057 Chisq statistic for the difference in AUCs = .34, p=.558               Grouping variable: foreign Positives 22  negatives 52 The AUC of the empirical ROC curve for  turn =.89 The Standard Error of the AUC=.037 Chisq statistic for the difference in AUCs = 4.58, p=.032               Grouping variable: foreign Positives 22  negatives 52 The AUC of the empirical ROC curve for  price =.58 The Standard Error of the AUC=.072                              Chisq statistic for the difference in AUCs = 1.32, p=.25 -nproc mpg weight hd turn price,by(foreign) nog pause-Author------        Statistical section: Phillip Price, Phillip.Price@@nrma.com.au	Graphics and interface: Fred Wolfe, fwolfe@@southwind.netReferences----------DeLong ER et al, (1988) "Comparing the Areas Under Two or more CorrelatedReceiver Operating Characteristic Curves: A Nonparametric approach"Biometrics.  44,837-845Bamber, D (1975) "The Area Above the Ordinal Dominance Graph and the areabelow the receiver operating characteristic graph"Journal of Mathematical Psychology,   12,387-415See Also-------- Manual: [R] lrocOn-line: @lroc@, @rocgraph@ if installed
