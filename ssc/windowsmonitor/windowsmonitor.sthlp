{pstd}
Windows unfortunately does not stream the outputs from command-line activity (technically, the stdout and stderr streams) in such a way that they can appear inside Stata. 
When running a {cmd:winexec} command, Stata waits for the process launched by the command to terminate before proceeding, and only then will all the output appear inside Stata. 
If the command is time-consuming (such as calling CmdStan, which was the inspiration for this), not seeing progress can cause worry, or a waste of time, or undetected problems. 
{cmd:windowsmonitor} is a work-around for this problem, which pipes the output to a text file, checks that file every 2 seconds and displays anything new in it.

{phang}
{opt command} the Windows command, which will be invisibly augmented with the details to pipe output to winlogfile

{phang}
{opt winlogfile} file (and path, if desired) to store the output in; by default a Stata tempfile will be used, so there is nothing to be gained from specifying a tempfile macro here

{phang}
{opt waitsecs} number of seconds to wait for the first output before giving up


{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
The winlogfile will contain a line:

{cmd:Finished!}

{pstd}
once the command finishes, and it is this line that will signal to {cmd:windowsmonitor} to hand control back to Stata. If your Windows command will write "Finished!" to the screen for some reason, that will cause early handing back (or some other problem).

{pstd}
It is possible that there may be some contention for access to the winlogfile, although despite serious use on different project, computers and Windows versions, it has never happened yet.
