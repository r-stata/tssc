d 'INGAP': module to insert gap observations into a data set before output by listtex
d
d   ingap inserts gap and/or heading observations into a data set
"d before the      data set is output by the listtex package (q.v.),"
d which      outputs variables to table rows which the user can
"d insert into a TeX, LaTeX,      HTML or Microsoft Word table."
d ingap inserts observation next to (before or      after) each of
d a list of observations specified by the user. The user
"d specifies a list of integers, and ingap inserts gap observations"
d next to      the observations in the corresponding positions in
"d the data set, or in the      corresponding positions in each"
d by-group if by-variables are specified.      ingap assumes that
d the data set in memory has up to 3 classes of variables.
d These are the by-variables which define by-groups representing
"d the pages of      the table, a row label variable containing the"
"d row labels in the left margin      of the table, and the"
"d remaining variables, which may form the entries in the      table"
d rows. A gap observation inserted by ingap has the same values for
d the      by-variables as the observation next to which it was
"d inserted, a row label      value specified by the user, and"
d missing values (or possibly column headings)      in the
d remaining variables. ingap may also create an additional binary
"d    variable, identifying which observations are gap observations."
"d The user may      output the data set using listtex, or may"
"d alternatively create a plot for      immediate impact, using"
d Stata graphics together with the sencode package      (q.v.).
