.-help for ^xfrac^.-Tabulation using categories defined by fractions of a cut-off value-------------------------------------------------------------------^xfrac^ varname [fweights aweights] [^if^ exp ^in^ range]			, ^cut^off^(^#^)^ [ ^gp(^gpname^)^ ]Description-----------^xfrac^ provides a specialized tabulation (a 'wrapper' for -tabulate-).Each valid observation is first partitioned by varname into one of a setof 20 mutually-exclusive categories, the boundaries of which are defined by 'hard-wired' fractions of a user-specified cut-off value (in the sameunits as varname), with fractions ranging from 0.1 through to 3.0. This classification is then tabulated and, optionally, can be retained as a new variable.In effect ^xfrac^ provides a discrete representation of the distribution function for varname.Example: let varname be a measure of income and the cut-off be meanincome. ^xfrac^ shows the proportion of observations with incomeless than 10% of mean income, between 10% and 20% of mean income, between 20% and 30% of mean income, and so on (20 categories). Cumulative proportions are also shown.Mandatory---------^cut^off^(^#^)^  The user must specify a value for the cut-off value                 (in the same units as varname).Options-------^gp(^gpname^)^ creates a new categorical variable, gpname, containing	      categories summarising group membership.Example-------. ^sum x [aw=wgt]^. ^local mean = _result(3)^. ^xfrac x [aw=wgt], cut(`mean') gp(gpname)^  Author------Stephen P.
