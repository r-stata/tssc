You must ^tsset^ your data before using ^hegy4^; see help @tsset@.^varname^ may contain time-series operators; see help @varlist@.Description-----------^hegy4^ performs the Hylleberg et al. (HEGY, 1990) test for seasonal unit rootsin a quarterly timeseries. It estimates the four roots of the timeseriesrepresentation (1-B^^4) x(t) = e(t), where B is the backshift operator, andpresents estimates of these roots as Pi(1)..Pi(4). A joint test for Pi(3)=Pi(4)=0is also presented. Critical values are those appropriate for T=100, taken fromHEGY Table 1. Joint tests for Pi(2)=Pi(3)=Pi(4)=0 and Pi(1)=Pi(2)=Pi(3)=Pi(4)=0,with critical values, are those presented by Ghysels et al. (1994). Criticalvalues for the case of muliplicative seasonality (see below) are from tables 1a-cin Smith and Taylor (1998). Critical values are linearly interpolated for samplesizes in the ranges (48,100) and (100,200).Options-------^Det^, which may take on values ^none^, ^const^, ^seas^, ^trend^, ^strend^ or ^mult^, specifiesthe process to be tested. The default, as suggested by HEGY and Ghysels et al. (1994),is ^seas^, indicating that a set of 3 seasonal dummies plus constant are to beincluded in the regression. ^none^ specifies that no deterministic variables areto be included; ^const^ specifies only a constant. ^trend^ specifies that a trendis to be included along with a constant term. ^strend^ specifies that a trend isto be included along with seasonal dummies and a constant term. ^mult^ specifiesthat seasonal intercepts (the case of multiplicative seasonality, recommendedby Smith and Taylor (1998)) are to be included along with seasonal dummies and aconstant term.^Lags(^numlist^)^ specifies the lag orders to be used in augmenting the model withlags of the fourth difference of the timeseries. Its default is zero. If sequentiallags are specified starting with 1, HEGY4 automatically conducts a sequential t-testto determine the optimal lag length and optimal lags to be included in the auxiliaryregression. The ^LEVel(^#^)^ option may be used to control the size of the lag lengthtest. Note that the test size equals 1 minus the confidence interval (in percent).Taylor and Smith (2001, p. 204) recommend a test size of 25%, which corresponds to^LEV(75)^ on the command line. The ^NOTest^ option may be specified to suppress thelag length test and utilize the lags specified in the option in generating the teststatistic.^GEN^erate(^newvar^): as a diagnostic on the procedure, the residuals from the HEGYregression may themselves be regressed on four lags and the original regressors.The residuals from that auxiliary regression may optionally be saved via the^GEN^erate() option, which saves them as a new variable. Other diagnosticprocedures (such as a portmanteau test, e.g. ^wntestq^, or tests for normality,skewness and kurtosis) may be then applied to this variable. Examples--------	. ^use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/Mills2d/exchq^	. ^hegy4 exchq^		. ^hegy4 exchq, det(strend) lag(1/4)^		. ^hegy4 exchq, lag(1/4) level(75)^		. ^hegy4 exchq, det(seas) lag(1 3 5)^		. ^hegy4 exchq, det(mult) lag(1/8) notest^	. ^hegy4 exchq, gen(hegyres)^	. ^wntestq hegyres^References----------Franses, P.
