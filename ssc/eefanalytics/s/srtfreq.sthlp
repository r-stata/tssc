{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:srtfreq} Performs analysis of educational trials under the assumption of independent errors among pupils; this can also be used with schools as fixed effects.
The analysis produces {cmd:Effect Size} (ES) estimates for both conditional and unconditional model specifications in Simple Randomised Trials. It also allows for sensitivity analysis options such as permutations
and bootstraps.


{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Model}

{phang}
{opt seed(#)} Sets seed number for permutations/bootstraps.

{phang}
{opt nperm(#)} Specifies number of permutations required to generate a permutated p-value. 
When specified, a list of generated variables ({cmd:PermC_I#}, {cmd:PermUnc_I#}) attaches to the user's dataset containing the permutated estimates. 
I# denotes number of arms of the {it:interv_var} and C/Unc denotes Conditional and Unconditional estimates. 

{phang}
{opt nboot(#)} Specifies number of bootstraps required to generate bootstrap confidence intervals. 
When specified, a list of generated variables ({cmd:BootC_I#}, {cmd:BootUnc_I#}) attaches to the user's dataset containing the bootstrap estimates. 
I# denotes number of arms of the {it:interv_var} and C/Unc denotes Conditional and Unconditional estimates. 

{phang}
Any attached variables from previous use of {cmd:srtfreq} will be replaced.


{dlgtab:Reporting}

{phang}
{opt noisily} Displays the permutated/bootstrapped conditional models' regression results as they occur.
 
{phang}
{opt showprogress} Displays progress of permutations/bootstraps using dots, counting them by blocks of 10.
