d 'PLSSEM': module to implement Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM)
d
d  The syntax of plssem reflects the measurement and structural
"d part of a PLS-SEM model, and accordingly    requires the user to"
d specify both of these parts simultaneously. Since a full PLS-SEM
"d model would include a    structural model, i.e., the relationship"
"d between latent variables (LV), one needs to have at least two"
d latent    variables specified in the measurement part. Each
"d latent variable will be defined by a block of indicators    (say,"
"d indblock). For example, if we have two latent variables in our"
"d PLS-SEM model, the plssem syntax    requires to specify the"
d measurement part by typing (LV1 > indblock1) (LV2 > indblock2)
d following the command    name. Note that we can specify as many
d LVs as it is needed in the model.
