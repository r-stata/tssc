That is to say, {hi:custom1} is set to be the same as {hi:blackbg}, {hi:custom2}is set to be the same as {hi:whitebg}, and {hi:custom3} is set to be the same as {hi:monochrome}.The user can therefore change the preferences of scheme {hi:custom}{it:#} temporarily, and returnthem to their original values afterwards. For further details on graphics preference schemes, see helpfor {help gprefs}.{title:Remarks}{p}Stata provides six graphics schemes, of which three ({hi:blackbg}, {hi:whitebg} and {hi:monochrome})are standard and cannot be modified by the user, and the other three ({hi:custom1}, {hi:custom2}and {hi:custom3}) are customizable and can be modified by the user. However, when shipped,{hi:custom1} is identical to {hi:blackbg}, {hi:custom2} is identical to {hi:whitebg}, and{hi:custom3} is identical to {hi:monochrome}. This makes it easy for users to create customizedschemes similar to one of the standard schemes, but different in a few details. {cmd:gpreset}allows the user to reset the customized settings in a single command. It is probably a good ideafor the user to store frequently-used customized settings as sequences of {help gprefs} commandsin ado-files, which can convert the original values of the preferences of one of the customizedschemes to the desired values. The user may also include one or more {cmd:gpreset} commandsin the file {hi:profile.do}, so that every Stata session starts with the customized schemes setto their original values; see help for {help profile}.{title:Examples}{p}The following example will reset the settings of the scheme {hi:custom3} to their original values,then set the thickness of pen 1 temporarily to 4, create a plot, and finally reset the settingsback to their original values again.{p 16 20}{inp:. gpreset 3}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. gprefs set custom3 pen1_thick 4}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. gprefs query custom3}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. gprefs set window scheme custom3}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. gprefs set window update}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. grap mpg weight,s([foreign]) ylabel xlabel}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. gpreset 3}{p_end}{p 16 20}{inp:. gprefs query custom3}{p_end}{title:Author}{p}Roger Newson, King's College, London, UK.Email: {browse "mailto:roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk":roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk}{title:Also see}{p 0 10}{bind: }Manual:   {hi:[G] gprefs}, {hi:[G] pens}, {hi:[G] symbol}{p_end}{p 0 10}On-line:   help for {help gprefs}, {help grsym}, {help grcolor}, {help graph}{p_end}
