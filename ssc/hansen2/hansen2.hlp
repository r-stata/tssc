Hansen's Test for Parameter Instability                      [STB-23: sts7.5]---------------------------------------	^hansen2^ [varlist] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [^, r^egress ^tsfit^-options]	Tests the null hypothesis of constant parameters from a regression using^varlist^ against the alternative hypothesis that the parameters follow amartingale.  ^hansen2^ prints individual statistics for each of the parametersin the model as well as a statistic for a joint test of all of the parameters.The test statistics are based on the residuals from the regression model in^varlist^ estimated over the entire sample.  ^hansen2^ uses ^tsfit^ (sts4: STB-15; sts4.1: STB-16) to estimate the model, andall the ^tsfit^ options can be specified.  The ^regress^ option displays theregression output; the default is to suppress this output.Use of ^hansen2^ requires that ^tsfit^ be installed.Author------	Ken Heinecke	Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City	816-881-2199 (FAX)Note----	^hansen2^ differs from ^hansen^ in just one detail.	Minimal changes were made by Nicholas J. Cox to 	fix a problem with tempfile names under Windows. 	Thanks to David Greenberg who alerted Statalist	to the problem and several Statalist members who	suggested ideas on fixing it. References----------Hansen, B.E. 1992.
