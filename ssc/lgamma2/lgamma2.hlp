{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:lgamma2} fits a maximum-likelihood 2-parameter log-gamma regression model of {it:depvar} 
on {it:indepvars}, where {it:depvar} is a non-negative count variable. The program may be used to 
model under-dispersed Poisson count data. Under-dispersion is indicated if the scale parameter, phi, 
is greater than 1; values under 1 indicate over-dispersion. Other methods are available for modeling 
overdispersed Poisson data, including the negative binomial, but few methods are commonly available to
deal with under-dispersion. {cmd:lgamma2} can also be used with models having a positive continuous 
response. 


{p 4 4 2}{cmd:lgamma2} acccepts all of the {it:help maximize} options, the {it:constraint()} 
option, and all survey options and capabilities documented in {cmd:[SVY]}; including 
multi-level surveys; poststratification; and BRR, jackknife, and linearization VCE estimators.

{p 4 4 2}This program uses {cmd:ml lf} method. 


{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Model}

{phang}
{opth offset(varname)} specifies a {it:varname} in model with coefficient constrained to 1.

{phang}
{opth exposure(varname)} specifies a {it:ln(varname)} in model with coefficient constrained to 1.

{phang}
{opth constraints(constraints)} apply specified linear constraints.



{dlgtab:SE/Robust}

{phang}
{opth cluster(varname)} 

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:robust} specifies that the Huber/White/sandwich estimator of
variance is to be used in place of the traditional calculation.  {cmd:robust}
combined with {cmd:cluster}{cmd:(}{cmd:)} allows observations which are not
independent within cluster (although they must be independent between
clusters).  If you specify {cmd:pweight}s, {cmd:robust} is implied.

{phang}
{opth vce(options)} allowed. {cmd:vce}{cmd:(}{cmd:)} supports {it:robust}, {it:opg}, and {it:native}.
{cmd:vce} does not support options {it:bootstrap} or {it:jacknife}, However,  {cmd:lgamma2} does support  
the {cmd:bootstrap} and {cmd:jacknife} commands, so these modeling capabilities are allowed.  


{dlgtab:Reporting}
   
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:level(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the confidence level, in percent,
for confidence intervals of the coefficients; see help {help level}.

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:nolog} suppresses the iteration log.


{dlgtab:max options}

{phang}

{p 4 8 2}
{it:maximize_options}: technique(algorithm_spec), [no]log, trace, hessian, gradient, showstep, 
shownrtolerance, difficult, iterate(#), tolerance(#), ltolerance(#), gtolerance(#), nrtolerance(#), 
nonrtolerance, from(init_specs); see {help maximize}.  


{dlgtab:svy options}

{phang}
{it:survey_options} are all available. See help {help svy}

{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:lgamma2} is a user authored program. Support is by author. 


{pstd}
{cmd:lgamma2} requires a response with any positive real number. A response of 0 will 
result in an error.
