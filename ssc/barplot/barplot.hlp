The height of each bar isgiven by the y variable, the width via the width option, the base viathe base option and the horizontal centre of each bar by xvar.^barplot^ could be used, for example, to    plot monthly totals or other time series as a series of touching    bars, positive and negative values shown upwards and downwards    (rainfall/evaporation, profit/loss, income/expenditure)    show histograms, especially those with more than 50 bins (classes)    or unequal bin widths (class intervals), or with unshaded bars    show the difference between two histograms as a series of bars that    may be positive or negative    show J.W. Tukey's rootograms, with the square root of frequencies on    the y axis.Note especially in the case of histograms or rootograms that thefrequencies must be calculated beforehand.Through the ^width()^ option, ^barplot^ could be used to produceoverlapping or underlapping bars, if desired for some reason.Options-------^width(^string^)^ specifies how the widths of the bars are determined.    ^width(^widthvar^)^ specifies that they are given by widthvar.    ^width(^#^)^ specifies that they are constant and equal to #.    The default is ^width(1)^.^base(^string^)^ specifies how the bases of the bars are determined.    ^base(^basevar^)^ specifies that they are given by basevar.    ^base(^#^)^ specifies that they are constant and equal to #.    The default is ^base(0)^.^months^ without ^xlabel( )^ automatically produces    ^xla(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12)^.^join^ specifies that bars that do not touch will be joined, i.e.    connected by fragments of a baseline. Separate bars usually look    better on histograms containing gaps (bins with zero frequency).    Joined bars often look better with time series plots.graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^, other than    ^symbol^ and ^connect^, which are set to ^i^ and ^L^ for each y    variable, and ^xlabel^ by itself. Note that these options do not    include ^shading^.Examples--------        . ^barplot pop age^        . ^barplot rain month, mon^        . ^barplot males females age^    Histogram from data:        . ^genfreq r if r > 0, w(1) b(Br) f(Fr)^        . ^barplot Fr Br, w(1)^    OR  . ^histplot r if r > 0, w(1)^    Histogram from data, discrete variables:        . ^egen freq = count(rep78), by(rep78)^    OR  . ^genfreq rep78, fg(freq)^        . ^barplot freq rep78, w(0.5) yla xla(1,2,3,4,5)^    Histogram with unequal bin widths (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989,    p.19):        . ^input centre width freq^        . ^112.5 25 38^        . ^137.5 25 27^        . ^162.5 25 15^        . ^187.5 25 11^        . ^250 100 4^        . ^350 100 4^        . ^450 100 1.8^        . ^550 100 2^        . ^700 200 1.2^        . ^900 200 0.2^        . ^barplot freq centre, w(width) l2(Frequency per 25000)^            ^b2(Population in 000) yla^    Superimposed histograms for different groups:        . ^genfreq length, w(5) bg(Blength) fg(Flength) by(foreign)^        . ^gen Flengthf = Flength if foreign^        . ^gen Flengthd = Flength if !foreign^        . ^barplot Flengthf Flengthd Blength, w(5)^    Normal and inverted histograms for different groups:        . ^gen nFlf = -Flength if foreign^        . ^barplot nFlf Flengthd Blength, w(5)^    Separate histograms for different groups:        same colour:        . ^barplot Flength Blength, w(5) by(foreign)^        different colours:        . ^barplot Flengthf Flengthd Blength, w(5) by(foreign)^    Superimposed histograms for different variables:        . ^genfreq n, w(0.5) bg(Bn) fg(Fn)^        . ^genfreq x, w(0.5) bg(Bx) fg(Fx)^        . ^stack Bx Fx Bn Fn, into(B F) wide clear^        . ^barplot Fx Fn B, w(0.5)^    Separate histograms for different variables:        . ^barplot Fx Fn B, w(0.5) by(_stack)^Author------         Nicholas J.
