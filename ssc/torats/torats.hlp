.-help for ^torats^                    (Statalist distribution, 12 Dec 2006).-Write program and data for use in RATS econometrics package-----------------------------------------------------------    ^torats^ [varlist] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] ,^File^(string) [^noCASE^ ^Replace^]Description-----------^torats^ facilitates the transfer of data to the RATS package via ASCII textfiles (that is, it does not create a RATS binary database, but then neither does Stat/Transfer). If executed in simplest form, ^torats,file(filename)^,it creates two files: ^filename.rat^, containing a shell RATS program thatwill read the data, and ^filename.raw^, the data themselves. If files withthose names already exist, the ^replace^ option must be used. It is left tothe user to write the appropriate timeseries calendar statements, if the dataare indeed in timeseries format, or modify the allocate statement to indicatethat these are panel data, etc.Since RATS does not handle string variables, only numeric variables are transferred. The numeric values of variables which appear in Stata as theirvalue labels (e.g. foreign in the auto.dta dataset) are transferred, sincethe value labels could not be used in RATS. Unless the ^nocase^ option isutilized, casewise deletion is performed so that only observations with complete data are transferred to the outputfile.If no ^varlist^ is given, all variables are transferred to the output files.An explicit ^varlist^ overrides this behavior.Although the .rat file is specific to RATS (www.estima.com), its format isvery similar to that used by TSP, eViews, or other commonly used econometricspackages.Example-------	. ^use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/greene2000/tbl15-1.dta,clear^	. ^reshape wide i f c,i(year) j(firm)^		. ^torats,file(grunfeld)^		. ^torats i1 i2 i3 i4 i5 if year>1940, file(grunfeld2)^		. ^webuse auto^		. ^torats mpg rep78 weight length, file(autodat) nocase replace^ Authors-------Christopher F Baum, Boston College, USAbaum@@bc.eduNicholas J.
