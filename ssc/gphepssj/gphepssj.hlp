If the list is {it:name_1 ... name_n}, then the .gph files are assumed to be named{it:name_1{sf:.gph} ... name_n{sf:.gph}}, and the .eps files are created as  {it:name_1{sf:.eps} ... name_n{sf:.eps}}.If the .eps files already exist, then they are replaced.{title:Remarks}{p}{cmd:gphepssj} was written to save SJ authors the trouble of writing multiple {help translategph:translate}commands and finding out and remembering the default {cmd:xsize} and {cmd:ysize} options for {help translategph:translate}used by the SJ editors. It is intended for SJ authors who wish to preview their inserts using {help sjlatex:SJ LaTeX}with the figures at the right size. It should be stressed that the SJ editorsprefer to be supplied with the original .gph files in a SJ submission, so they can manually adjust them.For further SJ submission guidelines, refer to the {browse "http://www.stata-journal.com/":SJ Web site}.{title:Example}{p 16 20}{inp:. gphepssj figurew figurex figurey figurez}{p_end}{title:Author}{p}Roger Newson, King's College, London, UK.Email: {browse "mailto:roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk":roger.newson@kcl.ac.uk}{title:Also see}{p 0 10}{bind: }Manual:   {hi:[G] translate}{p_end}{p 0 10}On-line:   help for {help graph}, {help translategph}, {help sj}, {help sjlatex}{p_end}
