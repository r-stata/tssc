{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:des10} produces a summary of the dataset stored in the format od Stata-10. This command
is for Stata-9 users only.

{phang}
{cmd: des10} has no options. For saved results see help for official {helpb describe:describe}. {it:varlist}
and {it:sortlist} are always saved. The following are never saved: {cmd:r(N_max)}, {cmd:r(k_max)}, and
{cmd:r(widthmax)}. This command is primarily for the programmers. Most users will {helpb use10:use10} the
dataset and describe it later with Stata's native {helpb describe:describe}.

{phang}
{cmd: des10} cannot describe datasets located on the web. Copy the data to a temporary file first.
