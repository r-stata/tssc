Under some circumstances, you may want to estimate a model (suchas a linear regression) pooling all data available during a fixed window, generatinga single set of coefficients. This can be achieved by {cmd:rolling2} with the {cmd:onepanel} option. Without that option, {cmd:rolling2} produces the same resultsas official {cmd:rolling}.{title:Options}{p 0 4}{cmd:onepanel} specifies that a single model is to be be estimatedover all panels of a panel dataset, ignoring the setting of the {cmd:panelvar}.{title:Examples}{p 8 12}{stata "webuse grunfeld" :. webuse grunfeld}{p_end}{p 8 12}{stata "rolling2 _b _se, window(5) onepanel: regress invest mvalue kstock" :. rolling2 _b _se, window(5) onepanel: regress invest mvalue kstock} {p_end}{title:Author}{p 0 4} Christopher F.
