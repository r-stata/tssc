.-help for ^inequal2^                                           (Philippe Van Kerm).-Measures of inequality (revised)---------------------------------      ^inequal2^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] ^[^weight^]^^aweight^s and ^fweight^s are allowed; see help @weights@.Description------------This ado computes a series of inequality measures of the variable varname.It is a slightly revised version of @inequal@ published by Edward Whitehousein STB-23.The inequality measures computed are: the "relative mean deviation",the "coefficient of variation", the "standard deviation of logs", the"Giniindex", the "Mehran index", the "Piesch index", the "Kakwani index", "Theilentropy index", the "mean log deviation" and the "generalised entropy measure"with sensitivity parameter (-1) [see, e.g., Coulter [1989] for a definitionof these measures].Four changes have been made compared to @inequal@:   - Inclusion of the "generalised entropy measure" with sensitivity       parameter (-1);   - Acceptation of ^aweight^s;   - Inclusion of saved results in global macros;   - With weighted data, ranks are computed differently.Saved Results--------------    S_1  contains the "relative mean deviation"    S_2  contains the "coefficient of variation"    S_3  contains the "standard deviation of logs"    S_4  contains the "Gini coefficient"'    S_5  contains the "Mehran index"    S_6  contains the "Piesch index"    S_7  contains the "Kakwani index"    S_8  contains the "Theil index (or generalised entropy measure with                        sensitivity parameter 1)"    S_9  contains the "Mean Log Deviation (or generalised entropy measure with                        sensitivity parameter 0)"     S_10 contains the "Generalised entropy measure with sensitivity parameter                       -1"	Author-------	Philippe VAN KERM <philippe.vankerm@@fundp.ac.be>	University of Namur, Department of Economics	Rempart de la Vierge 8	B-5000 Namur, Belgium.References-----------	Coulter Ph.
