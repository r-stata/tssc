{title:Description}

{pstd}{opt rassign} performs a regression-based test for the (conditional) random assignment of individuals in urns to peer groups (Jochmans, 2020). The dependent variable is a characteristic of the individual. 
The independent variable is the average characteristic of the individual's peers. The test controls for fixed effects at the urn level by default. The optional w are additional covariates that can be controlled for. The command can equally be used to test for the presence of peer effects in the linear-in-means model without modification.
