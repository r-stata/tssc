Choice oftravelmode can also be specified with the {cmd:mode()} option.{p 4 4 2} {cmd:traveltime} generates the variables {cmd:days},{cmd:hours}, {cmd:mins}, and {cmd:traveltime_dist}. The first three variablescorrespond to the number of days, hours, andminutes it takes to travel between the origin and destination.  For example,if the travel time between origin and destination is 1 day, 7 hours, and 37mins, the values for {cmd:days}, {cmd:hours}, and {cmd:mins} would be 1, 7, and37, respectively.  The variable {cmd:traveltime_dist} is the distance betweenthe sets of points.  The {cmd:traveltime_dist} will be reported in milesunless the kilometers ({cmd:km}) option is specified.{title:Options}{phang} {cmd:start_x(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} specifies the variable containingthe geocoded x coordinate of the starting point.  {cmd:start_x()} isrequired.{phang} {cmd:start_y(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} specifies the variable containingthe geocoded y coordinate of the starting point.  {cmd:start_y()} is required.{phang} {cmd:end_x(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} specifies the variable containingthe geocoded x coordinate of the destination.  {cmd:end_x()} is required.{phang} {cmd:end_y(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} specifies the variable containingthe geocoded y coordinate of the destination.  {cmd:end_y()} is required.{phang} {cmd:mode(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} specifies the mode choice of the trip.The values are set to {cmd:1} for car, {cmd:2} for public transportation, and {cmd:3} forwalking.  The default mode is car.{phang} {cmd:km} specifies that {cmd:traveltime_dist} be reported inkilometers rather than in miles (the default).{title:Note and warning} {p 4 4 2} {cmd:traveltime} requires that the latitude and longitude of theorigin and destination points be in decimal degrees.  This task can beaccomplished using the {cmd:geocode} command.{p 4 4 2}Google Maps has a daily limit of maximum queries that is notcurrently known.  If you use {cmd:traveltime}, you should use it in accordancewith Google's terms of use.  For more information on the terms of service of GoogleMaps, see {browse "http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms.html"}.{title:Example}{phang}{cmd:. traveltime, start_x(begin_long) start_y(begin_lat) end_x(end_long) end_y(end_lat) mode(autochoice)}{p_end} {title:Authors}{pstd}Adam Ozimek{p_end}{pstd}Econsult Corporation{p_end}{pstd}Philadelphia, PA{p_end}{pstd}ozimek@econsult.com{p_end}      {pstd}Daniel Miles{p_end}{pstd}Econsult Corporation{p_end}{pstd}Philadelphia, PA{p_end}{pstd}miles@econsult.com{p_end}    {title:Also see}{p 4 14 2}Article:  {it:Stata Journal}, volume 11, number 1: {browse "http://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=dm0053":dm0053}{p 4 14 2}{space 3}Help:  {helpb geocode} (if installed){p_end}
