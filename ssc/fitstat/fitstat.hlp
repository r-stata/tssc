.-help for ^fitstat^ - 1.6.2 - 11/27/00.-Compute fit statistics for single equation regression models.-------------------------------------------------------------    ^fitstat^ [^, s^aving^(name)^ ^u^sing^(name)^ ^b^ic ^f^orce ^save^ ^dif^]Description-----------^fitstat^ is a post-estimation command that computes a variety of measuresof fit for many kinds of regression models.  It works after the following:^clogit^, ^cnreg^, ^cloglog^, ^intreg^, ^logistic^, ^logit^, ^mlogit^, ^nbreg^, ^ocratio^,^ologit^, ^oprobit^, ^poisson^, ^probit^, ^regress^, ^zinb^, and ^zip^.  With the ^s^aving^()^and ^u^sing^()^ options, it can also be used to compare fit measures for twodifferent models.For all models, ^fitstat^ reports the log-likelihoods of the full andintercept-only models, the deviance (D), the likelihood ratio chi-square(G2), Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), AIC*N, the Bayesian InformationCriterion (BIC), and BIC'.For all models except ^regress^, ^fitstat^ reports McFadden's R2, McFadden'sadjusted R2, the maximum likelihood R2, and Cragg & Uhler's R2.  Thesemeasures all equal R2 for OLS regression.  ^fitstat^ reports R2 and theadjusted R2 after ^regress^.fitstat reports the regular and adjusted count R2 for categorical data models.For ordered or binary logit or probit models, as well as models for censoreddata (^tobit^, ^cnreg^, or ^intreg^), it also reports McKelvey and Zavonia's R2.In addition, it reports Efron's R2 for ^logit^ or ^probit^.Not all measures are provided for models estimated with ^pweight^s or ^iweight^s.Options-------^saving(^name^)^ saves the computed measures in a matrix for subsequent    comparisons.  Name cannot be longer than 4 characters.^using(^name^)^ compares the fit measures for the current model with those of    the model saved as name.  Name cannot be longer than 4 characters.^bic^ only presents information measures.^force^ will compare two models even when the number of observations or the    estimation method varies between the two models.^save^ and ^dif^ are equivalents of saving(0) and using(0) and do not require    the user to provide model names.Examples--------To compute fit statistics for a single model: . ^use mroz,clear^ . ^logit lfp k5 k618 age wc hc lwg inc^ . ^fitstat^To compute and save fit measures: . ^logit lfp k5 k618 age wc hc lwg inc^ . ^fitstat, saving(mod1)^To compare saved model to current model: . ^logit lfp k5 k618 age age2 wc hc lwg inc^ . ^fitstat, using(mod1)^.-Authors: J.
