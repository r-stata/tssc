ThenSimpson's index is SUM p^^2. If one value of p is 1, and the others thusall 0, this index takes on a maximum value of 1. If all p are 1 / n, ittakes on a minimum value of 1 / n.Shannon entropy is - SUM p ln p = SUM p ln 1/p. If one value of p is 1,this index takes on a minimum value of 0. If all p are 1 / n, it takeson a maximum value of ln n.Dissimilarity index is (1 / 2) SUM | p - 1 / n |. If one value of p is1, this index takes on a maximum value of (n - 1) / n. If all p are 1 /n, it takes on a minimum value of 0.These measures are known under a variety of names, and a variety ofrelated guises, in different fields.fweights and aweights are allowed.Options-------^by(^byvarlist^)^ specifies that calculations should be performed    separately for groups defined by byvarlist.^numeq^ specifies that Simpson's index and entropy are to be converted    to number equivalents, namely 1 / Simpson's index and exp(entropy).^gensim( )^, ^genent( )^ and ^gendiss( )^ specify that new variables    should be generated containing values of the three measures.tabdisp_options are options of ^tabdisp^ controlling the tabulation of    results. The default is ^format(%4.3f)^.Examples--------    . ^ineq income^Author------         Nicholas J.
