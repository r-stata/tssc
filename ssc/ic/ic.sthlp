{title:Summary}
{p2colset 5 10 10 2}{...}
{p2col :}It has become more common to investigate not only single factors effect 
on a outcome but also to look at the interaction between factors, as is 
facilitated by the last decades massive increase in computer resources to 
gather and analyses large databases. Several approaches haves been promoted.{p_end}

{p2col :}For the analyzes of binary (or count) data, a fairly well established 
position holds, that loglinear models estimating measures of relative risk type 
represent a convenient choice, whereas interactions are often best interpreted 
if estimated on a linear/additive scale. {p_end}

{p2col :}This code implement the procedure described in 
{help ic##HL1992:Hosmer & Lemeshow (1992)} and 
{help ic##A2005:Alfredsson et all (2005)} purely in Stata. {p_end}

{p2col :}These two sources however both uses odds ratios as approximations for 
relational risks. This code on the other hand opens up for using proper 
estimates of relational risks.

{pstd}Tool for calculating 3 different measures of interaction contrast 
(biological interaction) on an additive scale:  relative excess risk due to 
interaction [RERI], attributable proportion [AP] and synergy index [S].
{p_end}

{pstd}Corresponding 95% confidence intervals aand two-tailed tests for no 
interaction (RERI=0, AP=0, S=1, respectively) are given as well.{p_end}

 B, on a dichotome outcome Y.
Define Pij as the average risk (the incidence proportion) when A = i and B = j,
i = 0,1 and j = 0,1.{break}
And define the relative risk as RRij = Pij / P00.{p_end}

{pstd}The biological interaction measures is defined as{break}

{help ic##V2014:VanderWeele (2014)} {help ic##R2008:Rothman (2008)}.{p_end}

{pstd}The estimation/approximation of the RRs are described in
{help ic##HL1992:Hosmer & Lemeshow (1992)} {help ic##A2005:Alfredsson et all (2005)}, 
{help ic##C2009:Cummings (2009)} and {help ic##V2014:VanderWeele (2014)}.

{dlgtab 4:Understanding biological interaction}
{pstd}Below are some (sometimes slightly modified) quotes to help understand 
biological interaction.{p_end}

{pstd}The term statistical interaction is intended to denote the 
interdependence between the effects of two or more factors within the confines 
of a given model of risk. The evaluation of interaction depends on the model 
chosen. ({help ic##R1980:Rothman (1980)}){p_end}

{pstd}Biologic interaction may be defined as the interdependent operation of 
two or more causes to produce disease. ({help ic##R1980:Rothman (1980)}){p_end}

{pstd}Although we may not be able to estimate the additive interaction, i.e. 
p11 - p10 - p01 + p00, directly, we can still proceed as follows. {break}
If we divide by p00 we obtain the following: RERI = RR11 - RR10 - RR01 + 1" 
{help ic##V2014:VanderWeele (2014)}{p_end}

{pstd}"However, again, only the direction, rather than the magnitude, of RERI is 
needed to draw conclusions about the public health relevance of interaction.
 {help ic##V2014:VanderWeele (2014)}{p_end}

{pstd}Another measure of additive interaction that is sometimes used is called 
the attributable proportion and is defined as: AP = RERI / RR11 and essentially 
measures the proportion of the risk in the doubly exposed group that is due to 
the interaction itself. {help ic##V2014:VanderWeele (2014)}{p_end}

{pstd}"The logistic regression model and the Cox regression model are probably 
the most commonly used statistical models in epidemiologic analysis to day.{break} 
Because these models are exponential they are inherently multiplicative and 
become additive only after logarithmic transformation. {break}
Thus, absence of an interaction term in such a model implies a multiplicative 
relation between the disease rates and the presence of an interaction term 
implies departure from multiplicativity, rather than from additivity. {break}
Therefore, the interaction term, in one of these models, has no direct 
relevance for the issue of whether or not biological interaction is present.{break} 
However, the presence of biological interaction can still be asessed from the 
results of a logistic regression model or a Cox regression model, but this 
requires that the model is defined in a special way and that the analysis is 
done adequately." {help ic##A2005:Alfredsson et all (2005)}{p_end}

{pstd}"In this study we showed that calculating measures of interaction on an 
additive scale using preventive factors can give inconsistent results.{break} 
Researchers should therefore be aware to not use preventive factors to 
calculate these measures unless they have been recoded." 
{help ic##K2011:Knol et all (2011)}{p_end}

{dlgtab 4:ic}
{pstd}Given a variable list staring with outcome, factor A, factor B end 
possibly some adjustment variables for the regression the ic estimates the RR
for A, B, the interaction between A and B, RERI, AP and S as well as their 95%
confidence intervals.{p_end}

{pstd}Note that the interaction term is automatically created
based on variable 2 and variable 3 (outcome is variable number 1) in the 
regression.{p_end}

{dlgtab 4:ici}
{pstd}The immediate form of ic. Requires a 1 by 3 or 3 by 1 matrix 
containing the logs of the RRs and their 3 by 3 covariance matrix as input. 
A local containing labels like "labelA labelB labelAB" is optional.{p_end}

{dlgtab 4:icp}
{pstd}This is the advanced prefix form letting the user define regression 
settings to use to get estimates of log relative risks to use interaction 
contrast.{p_end}

{pstd}Note that the interaction term is automatically created
based on variable 2 and variable 3 (outcome is variable number 1) in the 
regression.{p_end}

{pstd}Also note that {cmd:icp} only accepts logistic, logit, binreg, nbreg, 
poisson or stcox (stcox needs a stset first) as regression inputs. {break}
The key point for the regression is that it must produce estimates or at least 
approximations to relative risks.{p_end}

{dlgtab 4:Prefix icp and how it works}

{pstd}Using the oral cancer dataset what is done is shown below. In the example
the log odds are estimated using a logistic regression with option coef.{p_end}

	{cmd:* Generate dummy variables for the regression:}
	{cmd:. generate marker = inlist(alcohol, 0, 1) & inlist(smoking, 0, 1)}
	{cmd:. generate ind11 = (alcohol == 1 & smoking == 1) if marker}
	{cmd:.  replace ind11 = 0 if !missing(alcohol, smoking) & !marker}
	{cmd:. generate ind10 = (alcohol == 1 & smoking == 0) if marker}
	{cmd:.  replace ind10 = 0 if !missing(alcohol, smoking) & !marker}
	{cmd:. generate ind01 = (alcohol == 0 & smoking == 1) if marker}
	{cmd:.  replace ind01 = 0 if !missing(alcohol, smoking) & !marker}
	{cmd:* The values 0 and 1 above can be changed by options in icp}
	{cmd:* Run the regression on the dummy variables:}
	{cmd:. logistic cancer ind10 ind01 ind11, coef}
	{cmd:* Get the log relative risk estimates from the regression:}
	{cmd:. matrix b = r(table)}
	{cmd:. matrix b = b[1, 1..3]}
	{cmd:* Get the variance from the regression:}
	{cmd:. quietly vce}
	{cmd:. matrix V = r(V)}
	{cmd:. matrix V = V[1..3, 1..3]}
	{cmd:* The data used ici is:}
	{cmd:. matlist (b', V)}
	{cmd:* Call ici with estimates:}
	{cmd:. ici b V }
	{cmd:* And clean up:}
	{cmd:. drop ind10 ind01 ind11 marker}
	{cmd:. matrix drop b V}

{pstd}This is much like the description in {help ic##HL1992:Hosmer & Lemeshow (1992)} 
and {help ic##A2005:Alfredsson et all (2005)}.
With the exception that their spreadsheet is replaced with the Stata command
{cmd:ici} which described further down. Instead of these commands the prefix
{cmd:icp} could have been used:{p_end}

	{cmd:. icp: logistic cancer alcohol smoking, coef}

{pstd}So in other words {cmd:icp} takes a regression command with at least 3 
variables and lets the first be the outcome, the next 2 variables be the factors 
used as base for the dummy variables and the rest of the variables are used for 
adjusting.{break}
And if the underlying regression is wanted then use the option show:{p_end}
 
	{cmd:. icp, show: logistic cancer alcohol smoking, coef}

{pstd}Note that the option show doesn't remove the dummy variables used in the 
regression.{p_end}
{pstd}If the calculation of the dummy variables should be based on other values
than 0 and/or 1 then use the options referenceA, referenceB, exposedA and/or 
exposedB.{p_end}

{pstd}So{p_end} 

	{cmd:. icp, referenceA(2) referenceB(3) exposedA(4) exposedB(5): logistic cancer alcohol smoking, coef}

{pstd}would be the same as the following dummy generating commands:{p_end}

	{cmd:. generate marker = inlist(alcohol, 2, 4) & inlist(smoking, 3, 5)}
	{cmd:. generate ind11 = (alcohol == 4 & smoking == 5) if marker}
	{cmd:.  replace ind11 = 0 if !missing(alcohol, smoking) & !marker}
	{cmd:. generate ind10 = (alcohol == 4 & smoking == 3) if marker}
	{cmd:.  replace ind10 = 0 if !missing(alcohol, smoking) & !marker}
	{cmd:. generate ind01 = (alcohol == 2 & smoking == 5) if marker}
	{cmd:.  replace ind01 = 0 if !missing(alcohol, smoking) & !marker}
 
{pstd}Please note that this might lead to a nonsense regression.{p_end}

{pstd}Of course it is possible to chose your own regression after icp, eg:{p_end}

	{cmd:. icp: poisson cancer alcohol smoking, irr vce(robust)}
	
	or
	
	{cmd:. icp: binreg cancer alcohol smoking, rr}

{pstd}However {cmd:icp} only accepts logistic, logit, binreg, nbreg, poisson or 
stcox (stcox needs a stset first) as regression inputs. The key point for the 
regression is that it must produce estimates or at least approximations to 
relative risks.{p_end}

{help ic##examples:Back to examples}


{marker example_4}{...}
{dlgtab 4:ici and how it works}

{pstd}{cmd:ici} can be used in interactively much the same way as the spreadsheet
in {help ic##A2005:Alfredsson et all (2005)}.{break}
It takes 3 estimates of the log relational risk (or approximating odds ratio) as 
first argument in a row or column vector (matrix), second argument is the 
3 by 3 variance matrix and finally (and optionally) labels to use in the output. {break}
So if 2 matrices and a macro for labels are defined as:{p_end}

	{cmd:. matrix b = 1.2039728, 1.0861898, 2.2012326}
	{cmd:. matrix V = .63333333, .38333333, .38333333}
	{cmd:. matrix V = V \ .38333333, .56388889, .38333333}
	{cmd:. matrix V = V \ .38333333, .38333333, .39380187}

	{cmd:. local labels "alcohol_NOT_smoking smoking_NOT_alcohol alcohol_AND_smoking"}

{pstd}Note that matrix b can b either a row or a column vector. {break}
Also one can enter a matrix as a string argument right away. {break}
So the call of {cmd:ici} could be:
{p_end}
	
	{cmd:. ici b V}
	
	or	
	
	{cmd:. ici "1.2039728, 1.0861898, 2.2012326" V "`labels'"}

{pstd}So the parameter label is optional.{p_end}

{marker example_5}{...}
{dlgtab 4:ic and how it works}

{pstd}{cmd:ic} is probably how most would like to use the code. Based on 
{help ic##C2009:Cummings (2009)} it offers some standard ways of estimating 
relative risks using {cmd:ic}. This example is based on the oral cancer 
dataset.{p_end}


{pstd}The command below perform the calculations based on odds ratio estimates
, option rrby(or), and show, option show, the underlying regression output:{p_end}
	{cmd:. ic cancer alcohol smoking, show rrby(or)}

{pstd}This is the classical method (and the default).{p_end}
	
{pstd}Here the poisson regression is used as a base for the relative risk 
estimates, option rrby(poisson). Also the controls and the cases are reversed 
for smoking, options referenceB(1) exposedB(0):{p_end}
	{cmd:. ic cancer alcohol smoking, referenceB(1) exposedB(0) rrby(poisson)}
	
{pstd}According to eg {help ic##C2009:Cummings (2009)} the poisson regression
makes robust estimates of the relative risks. However it tends to give too wide
confidence intervals.{p_end}

{pstd}Finally there is a stable estimation, option rrby(binomial), of the 
relative risks using estimates from a similar poisson regression as initiation 
for the binomial regression.{p_end}
	{cmd:. ic cancer alcohol smoking, rrby(binomial)}

{pstd}The binomial regression should give better estimates of the confidence 
intervals. But the algorithm isn't as stable. Hence we initiate with point
estimates from a similar poisson regression.{p_end}

{pstd}Note that if alcohol had eg 3 levels (eg 0 "No" 1 "Moderate" 2 "Extreme").
Then the interaction estimates for "No" (reference) versus "Moderate" (exposed)
would be the traditional usage of {cmd:ic}:{p_end}

	{cmd:. ic cancer alcohol smoking}

{pstd}And then the interaction estimates for "No" (reference, default = 0) 
versus "Extreme" (exposed) would be:{p_end}

	{cmd:. ic cancer alcohol smoking, exposedA(2)}

			Interaction exists if RERI != 0 or AP != 0 or S != 1              

{pstd}The factor smoke_AND_se2 is significantly different from 1 
(P-value = 0.0000), so there is a (statistical) multplicative interaction. 
And also by looking at RERI and AP there is a significant biological interaction 
(P-values are 0.0141 0.0028 respectively).{p_end}

{pstd}Now one could be interested in whether this result were the same if there
were a single SE gene present (exposed == 1):{p_end}

{pstd}Here we note that values for S could not be calculated. This is due to estimates
being to big to exponentiate. However here is only a biological interaction 
present (P-values: smoke_AND_se=0.2112, RERI=0.0044, AP=0.0004).{p_end}

be ignored. Here there are both a multplicative and a biological interaction 
present (P-values: smoke_AND_se=0.0000, RERI=0.0230, AP=0.0000){p_end}
