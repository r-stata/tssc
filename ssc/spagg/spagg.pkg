d 'SPAGG': module to create aggregate source or target contagion spatial effect variable for directed dyadic data
d
d  spagg generates an aggregate source or target contagion spatial
d effect variable for analysis of spatial dependence in directed
d dyad data. It can create spatial effect variables for spatial
"d lag, spatial-x and spatial error models. See"
d http://personal.lse.ac.uk/neumayer/spatial.pdf for an explanation
d of what constitutes aggregate source and target contagion.
d Requires installation of the mmerge package (q.v.)
