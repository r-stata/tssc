Counting how many subjects have records satisfying a condition--------------------------------------------------------------^longch^ idname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range], ^c(^string^)^Description-----------The command ^longch^ is used with data in which their are severalrecords per subject. The variable ^idname^ identifies the subjects,and the string in ^c()^ contains a logical condition. The programreports the number of subjects for which some records satisfy thecondition; the number for which no records satisfy the condition; andthe number of subjects for which every record satisfies the condition.In addition the logical variables ^_some^, ^_none^ and ^_every^ which flag the records are created. This is useful for dropping all recordsbelonging to subjects of a particular type, eg those with no recordssatisfying the condition.Options-------^c()^ is not an option - it contains a logical conditionExample-------Consider a longitudinal data set in which each record corresponds to avisit by a subject and the subject identity is in the variable id. Thecommand^longch id, c(height == . )^results in the output71  records fulfill the condition height == .some : 46  subjects have height == . in at least one recordnone : 51  subjects have height == . in no recordsevery: 0  subjects have height == . in every recordIn addition three logical variables called ^_some^, ^_none^,and ^_every^, are created for convenience in further manipulation(eg dropping or keeping records). These flag all records belonging tosubjects with some records satisfying the condition, and so on.Authors-------	Michael Hills        mhills@@regress.demon.co.uk        Tony Brady        tbrady@@rpms.ac.ukAlso see--------On-line: help for @count@, @unique@
