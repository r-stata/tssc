The     default is a short vertical bar, shorter than that in ^graph, oneway^.     ^graph, oneway^ interprets ^jitter( )^ as replacing short vertical     bars by sets of dots.     ^onewplot^ interprets ^jitter( )^ in the same way as does ^graph,^    ^twoway^.    ^graph, oneway^ does not allow tuning of ^xlabel( )^ -- the minimum    and maximum are always shown -- nor of whether a border or axes are    shown.     ^onewplot^ allows such tuning as with ^graph, twoway^.     ^onewplot^ uses only one colour in the body of the graph.     ^graph, oneway^ uses several colours with several variables.     ^onewplot^ allows the use of ^xline( )^ and ^yline( )^.     ^graph, oneway^ allows up to 20 variables or 52 groups to be shown.    ^onewplot^ allows up to 25 variables or groups to be shown.     ^graph, oneway rescale^ stretches each set of data marks to extend over    the whole horizontal range of the graph.     ^onewplot^ allows the ^rescale^ option of ^graph, twoway^, but it has     no effect, because internally the graph is of a single y-variable     versus a single x-variable, and ^rescale^ only affects graphs with     two or more y-variables.         ^graph^ myvar^, oneway by(^byvar^)^ requires data to be sorted by byvar.     ^onewplot^ myvar^, by(^byvar^)^ does not require this.     ^graph^ myvar^, oneway by(^byvar^)^ does not take the values of byvar    literally: displays for values 1, 2 and 4 will appear equally spaced.     ^onewplot^ myvar^, by(^byvar^)^ does take the values of byvar     literally.      (To tidy up an ordering, use ^egen^ with ^lgroup^ from ^egenodd^     from STB-50.)     ^onewplot^ with the ^stack^ option produces a variant on ^dotplot^     in which the magnitude axis is horizontal. There is no binning of     data, unlike that in ^dotplot^. Stata 6.0 will only use at most 8 characters from value labels in ^xlabel^s or ^ylabel^s.           Options-------^by(^byvar^)^ specifies that values of varname are to be shown separately    by groups defined by byvar. This option may only be specified with     a single variable.         If ^stack^ is also specified, then note that distinct values of any     numeric byvar are assumed to differ by at least 1. ^frac( )^ or the     prior use of ^egen^ with ^lgroup^ from ^egenodd^ from STB-50 will fix     any problems. ^stack^ specifies that data points with identical values are to be stacked,     as in ^dotplot^, except that the magnitude axis is horizontal and there     is no binning of data. ^frac(^#^)^ controls the fraction of vertical space taken up by stacked     data points under the ^stack^ option above. Default 0.8. This option     will not by itself change the appearance of a plot for a single     variable or group of data. graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^, other than    ^xlabel^ by itself and ^ylabel^ by itself.        ^yreverse^ may be useful.    The vertical scale may be extended by using ^yscale( )^.    ^connect( )^ is allowed but not obviously useful.     (For plots with connecting lines, see @parcoord@ from    STB-29.)  Examples--------        . ^onewplot length width height^         . ^onewplot length, by(grade)^         . ^onewplot length, by(grade) border xla(0(200)2000)^ 	. ^onewplot mpg, by(foreign) stack f(0.4)^ Author------         Nicholas J.
