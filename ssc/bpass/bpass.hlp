Christiano and Terry J. Fitzgerald (1999).The ^pl^ and ^pu^ arguments specify the minimum period of oscillation and maximumperiod of oscillation of the desired component of the time series, where 0 < pl < pu < infinity.The routine outputs a matrix fX which is the filtered time series. You should ^set matsize 800^ before calling this routine. Due to the matrix size limits,a timeseries longer than 400 periods cannot be handled by this routine. This program contains only the default filter recommended in Christiano and 		Fitzgerald (1999). This program was written by Eduard Pelz and any 		errors are my own and not the authors. For those who wish to use 		optimal band-pass filters other than the default filter please use the 		Matlab version of code available at www.clev.frb.org/economists/fitzgerald.Examples--------	. ^bpass gdp 6 32^ applied to quarterly data returns component with period between	                   1.5 and 8.0 years	. ^bpass ip 2 24^ applied to monthly data returns component with period up to 	                  2.0 years	                  Reference---------Lawrence J.
