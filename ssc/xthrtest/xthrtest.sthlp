{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:xthrtest} calculates the (time dependent) heteroskedasticity-robust HR statistic for serial correlation described in Born & Breitung (2016) for {varlist} of ue-residuals.

{pstd}
The underlying concept of the test boils down to regressing backwards demeaned residuals on lagged forward demeaned residuals using a heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust estimator. 
An F-test is then performed on the estimated coefficients. {bf:xthrtest} calculates the HR statistic that is asymptotically equivalent to this F-test.


{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{phang}{opt force} The test only works if the dataset contains no gaps and the residuals provided include the fixed effect. Force skips testing if the latter is true.


{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
Only valid for fixed effect models without gaps. Unbalanced panels (different starts/ends) are allowed.

{pstd}
You must use the {bf:ue}-option when predicting the residuals. That is, this test requires the fixed effect-included residuals (ci + eit).

{pstd}
Any mistakes are my own.

{pstd}
Just like academic papers, coding software takes time and effort. As a result, {bf:please cite the Stata Journal article}, Wursten (2018), when you make use of this command, just like you would cite a useful paper. A full reference can be found below.
This article contains additional information about the tests, its usage and its strengths, as well as some Monte Carlo evidence.

{cmd:xthrtest} stores the following in {cmd:r()}:

{p2col 5 15 19 2: Scalars}{p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:r(pvalue{it:i})}}The p-values are also stored as scalars (often more convenient){p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:r(hr{it:i})}}Same for the hr-statistics{p_end}
