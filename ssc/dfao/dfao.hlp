An additive outlier is a temporary shock or aberrationin the data, as exemplified by the shock to U.S. grain prices in the mid-1990s. The approach usedhere follows the method outlined in Vogelsang (1999) and Franses and Haldrup (1994). The presenceof additive outliers induce "in the errors a moving-average component with a negative coefficient"(Vogelsang 1999, p. 237). Schwert (1989) showed that MA errors with a negative component result inoversized unit root tests. Following Franses and Haldrup (1994), Vogelsang adds outlier dummyvariables to the augmented DF regression. The addition of these dummies does not affect the DF dis-tribution if the number of dummies is not too large (see Franses and Haldrup). Outliers are de-tected using an iterative method [see Vogelsang (pp. 240-2)]. Note that k+2 dummy variables areadded to the DF regression for each outlier found (the contemporaneous dummy and k+1 of its lags,where k is the lag length) because an additional lagged dummy is needed "to remove the influence ofthe outlier on the [kth lagged difference of the dependent variable].... If there is more than oneoutlier and k is moderately large, the degrees of freedom lost ... from outlier removal can be non-trivial" (Vogelsang 1999, p. 240).The data are detrended unless the ^notrend^ option is specified, in which case the data are de-meaned. If ^noconstant^ is specified, then the data are neither detrended nor demeaned, though thisoption cannot be used when testing for additive outliers (see the explanation of the ^noconstant^option below). The maximum lag order for the test is by default calculated from the sample size usinga rule provided by Schwert (1989, p. 151). The maximum lag order may also be provided with the ^maxlag^option, and may be zero. If the maximum lag order exceeds one, a sequential lag-length test is auto-matically performed for each lag using a user-specified criterion (choices are sequential-t test[see Ng & Perron (1995)], Akaike, Schwarz, or Hannan-Quinn information criteria [see references]). Ifthe sequential-t test is chosen, then lag-length testing stops when that coefficient's p-value is lessthan the test size specified by the user (see the explanation of the ^level^ option below). Note thatthe sample size is held constant over lags at the maximum available sample. Automatic lag selection canbe suppressed using the ^nolagtest^ option.Approximate 1%, 5%, and 10% critical values for the ADF unit root test are calculated using theresponse surface equations in Cheung and Lai (1995).^dfao^ prints the variable tested, the time period covered by the DF regression, the number ofobservations used in the DF regression, the value of maxlag and how it was selected (by the useror the Schwert criterion), deterministic terms used in the regression (none, constant, or constant +trend), the DF test statistic and the 1%, 5%, and 10% critical values, the MacKinnon (1994)approximate p-value for the test statistic, the optimal lag order, the RMSE (calculated from samplesize T), and the outliers together with their respective t-statistics, and critical values. If the^regress^ option (see below) is selected, the coefficient table for the DF regression is also dis-played. Note that t-statistics from the outlier test are printed as tau# and dummy variables areprinted as d#, where # is the observation number of the outlier. The outlier t-statistics and out-lier dummy variables are printed in the order in which outliers were detected, from most to leastsignificant. The particular information printed depends of course on the options chosen.^dfao^ places in the return array the number of outliers, the t-statistics for each outlier de-tected in the outlier test, the value of the t-statistic or information criterion and RMSE calcu-lated at each lag, the number of observations used in the DF regression, the value of maxlag, theactual number of lags used in the DF regression, the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable(rho), the DF test statistic (Zt), and the p-value corresponding to Zt. If outliers are detected,^dfao^ also returns a macro listing the dates of the outliers in the order in  which outliers weredetected (see the discussion of outlier t-statistics and dummy variables in the preceding para-graph). The particular data returned depends on the options chosen.Options-------^M^axlag(^#^) specifies the maximum lag order to be used in augmenting the Dickey-Fuller regressionand only accepts nonnegative integer values. If omitted, the maximum lag order is calculated asdescribed above. ^LLTC^(^t^|^aic^|^sc^|^hq^) stands for "lag length test criterion." Choices are "t" (sequentialt-test), "aic" (Akaike information criterion), "sc" (Bayesian Schwarz criterion), and "hq"(Hannan-Quinn criterion). Only one option may be specified. If omitted, ^LLTC^ defaults to thesequential t-test.^NOLA^gtest suppresses automatic lag-length testing. If ^nolagtest^ is specified and ^maxlag^ isomitted, then the DF regression is run with the number of lags determined by the Schwert criterionas described above. ^NOLA^gtest generates an error if ^LLTC^ is also specified.^NOAO^test suppresses the test for additive outliers. If this option is used then ^dfao^ works like^dfuller^, yet and unlike the latter routine, still provides for automatic lag-length determinationand response surface critical values.^NOCON^stant suppresses the constant in the DF regression. The data are neither demeaned nor de-trended. Because this option precludes both the inclusion of a trend in the DF regression and theoutlier test, specifying ^NOCON^stant on the command line automatically sets the ^NOTR^end and^NOAO^test options.^NOTR^end means that the data are demeaned rather than detrended. Since many time series exhibittrending behavior, the default is to include a trend in the auxiliary and DF regressions.^GEN^erate(^newvar^) specifies that the residuals from the DF regression should be saved as a newvariable for subsequent analysis. The residuals correspond to the DF regression using the lag-lengththat is specified as an option or computed internally.^REG^ress displays the coefficient table for the DF regression.^LEV^el(^#^) controls both the width of the confidence intervals for displayed statistics and the testsize used in both outlier testing and lag-length determination. The test size is calculated as100 - ^level^(^#^). If omitted, ^level^ equals the value contained in the global macro ^$S_Level^.Examples--------    . ^use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/macro/pervog92^    . ^dfao lfiuscpi^        . ^dfao lfiuscpi, notr lev(90)^        . ^dfao lfiuscpi, notr lev(90) lltc(aic)^    . ^dfao lfiuscpi, notr lev(90) reg^        . ^dfao lfiuscpi, notr lev(90) m(11) nola^        . ^dfao lfiuscpi, noao^        . ^dfao lfiuscpi, nocon^    . ^dfao lfiuscpi, gen(dfaores)^    . ^wntestq dfaores^References----------Akaike, H. 1973.
