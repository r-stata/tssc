d '_GRPROD': module to extend generate to produce row products
d
d rprod provides a multiplicative row function for egen analogous
d to the additive rsum function.  The product of observations of
d <varlist> meeting optional in and if conditions is returned in
d <newvar>. rprod insists that <newvar> is calculated in double
d precision.
