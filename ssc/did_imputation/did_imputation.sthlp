{title:Description}

{pstd}
{bf:did_imputation} estimates the effects of a binary treatment with staggered rollout allowing for arbitrary heterogeneity and dynamics of causal effects, using the imputation estimator of Borusyak et al. (2021).
{p_end}

{pstd}
The benchmark case is with panel data, in which each unit {it:i} that gets treated as of period {it:Ei} stays treated forever; 
some units may never be treated. Other types of data (e.g. repeated cross-sections) and other designs (e.g. triple-diffs) are also allowed;
see {help did_imputation##usage:Usage examples}.
{p_end}

{pstd}Estimation proceeds in three steps:{p_end}

{p2col 5 8 8 0 : 1.}{ul:Estimate} a model for non-treated potential outcomes using the non-treated (i.e. never-treated or not-yet-treated) 
observations only. The benchmark model for diff-in-diff designs is a two-way fixed effect (FE) model: Y_it = a_i + b_t + eps_it, 
but other FEs, controls, etc., are also allowed.{p_end}
{p2col 5 8 8 0 : 2.}{ul:Extrapolate} the model from Step 1 to treated observations, {ul:imputing} non-treated potential outcomes Y_it(0),
and obtain an estimate of the treatment effect {it: tau_it = Y_it - Y_it(0)} for each treated observation. (See {help did_imputation##impfails:What if imputation is not possible}){p_end}
{p2col 5 8 8 0 : 3.}{ul:Take averages} of estimated treatment effects corresponding to the estimand of interest.{p_end}

{title:What If Imputation Is Not Possible}

{phang}The imputation step (Step 2) is not always possible for all treated observations:{p_end}
{phang2}- With unit FEs, imputation is not possible for units treated in all periods in the sample;{p_end}
{phang2}- With period FEs, it is impossible to isolate the period FE from the variation in treatment effects
in a period when all units have already been treated (and if there are never-treated units);{p_end}
{phang2}- If you include group#period FEs, imputation is further impossible once all units {it:in the group} have been treated;{p_end}
{phang2}- Similar issues arise with other covariates in the model of Y(0).{p_end}

{phang}This is a fundamental issue: the model you specified does not allow to find unbiased estimates of treatment effects
for those observations (without restrictions on treatment effects; see Borusyak et al. 2021).

{phang}
If this problem arises (i.e. there is at least one treated observation that enters one of the estimands of interest with a non-zero weight
and for which the treatment effect cannot be imputed),
the command will throw an error and generate a dummy variable {it:cannot_impute} which equals to one for those observations.

{phang}You have two ways to proceed:{p_end}
{phang}- Modify the estimand, excluding those observations manually: via the {opt if} clause or by setting the weights on them to zero 
(via the {opt wtr} option);{p_end}
{phang}- Specify the {opt autosample} option that will do this automatically in most cases. But we recommend that you still review {it:cannot_impute}
to understand what estimand you will be getting.{p_end}

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Model of Y(0)}

{phang}{opt fe(list of FE)}: which FE to include in the model of Y(0). Default is {opt fe(i t)} for the diff-in-diff (two-way FE) model.
But you can include fewer FEs, e.g. just period FE {opt fe(t)} or, for repeated cross-sections at the individual level, {opt fe(state t)}. 
Or you can have more FEs: e.g. {bf:fe(}{it:i t{cmd:#}state}{bf:)} (for state-by-year FE with county-level data) 
or {bf:fe(}{it:i{cmd:#}dow t}{bf:)} (for unit by day-of-week FE). Each member of the list has to look like 
{it:v1{cmd:#}v2{cmd:#}...{cmd:#}vk}. If you want no FE at all, specify {opt fe(.)}.
{p_end}

{phang}{opt c:ontrols(varlist)}: list of time-varying controls{p_end}

{phang}{opt unitc:ontrols(varlist)}: list of continuous controls (often unit-invariant) to be included {it:interacted} with unit dummies. 
E.g. with {opt unitcontrols(year)} the regression includes unit-specific trends.{p_end}

{pmore}{it:Use with caution}: the command may not recognize that imputation is not possible for some treated observations.
For example, a unit-specific trend is not possible to estimate if only one pre-treatment observation is available for the unit, but it is not
guaranteed that the command will throw an error.
{p_end}

{phang}{opt timec:ontrols(varlist)}} list of continuous controls (often time-invariant) to be included {it:interacted} with period dummies.
E.g. with {opt timecontrols(population)} the regression includes {it:i.year#c.population}.{p_end}

{pmore}{it:Use with caution}: the command may not recognize that imputation is not possible for some treated observations.
{p_end}

{dlgtab:Estimands and Pre-trends}

{phang}{opt wtr(varlist)}: A list of variables, manually defining estimands of interest by storing the weights on the treated observations.{p_end}
{phang2}- If {help did_imputation##weights:estimation weights} ({bf:aw/iw/fw}) are used, {opt wtr} weights will be applied {it:in addition}
to those weights in defining the estimand.{p_end}
{phang2}- If nothing is specified, the default is the simple ATT across all treated observations (or, with {opt horizons} or {opt allhorizons}, by horizon). So {opt wtr}=1/number of the relevant observations. {p_end}
{phang2}- Values of {opt wtr} for untreated observations are ignored (except as initial values in the iterative procedure for computing SE).{p_end}
{phang2}- Values below 0 are only allowed  if {opt sum} is also specified (i.e. for weighted sums and not weighted averages).{p_end}
{phang2}- Using multiple {opt wtr} variables is faster than running {cmd:did_imputation} for each of them separately, and produces a joint variance-covariance matrix.{p_end}

{phang}{opt sum}: if specified, the weighted {it:sum}, rather than average, of treatment effects is computed (overall or by horizons).
With {opt sum} specified, it's OK to have some {opt wtr}<0 or even adding up to zero;
this is useful, for example, to estimate the difference between two weighted averages of treatment effects
(e.g. across horizons or between men and woment).{p_end}

{phang}{opt h:orizons(numlist)}: if specified, weighted averages/sums of treatment effects will be reported for each of these horizons separately
(i.e. tau0 for the treatment period, tau1 for one period after treatment, etc.). Horizons which are not specified will be ignored.
Each horizon must a be non-negative integer.{p_end}

{phang}{opt allh:orizons}: picks all non-negative horizons available in the sample.{p_end}

{phang}{opt hbal:ance}: if specified together with a list of horizons, estimands for each of the horizons will be based
only on the subset of units for which observations for all chosen horizons are available
(note that by contruction this means that the estimands will be based on different periods).
If {opt wtr} or estimation weights are specified, the researcher needs to make sure that the weights are constant over time
for the relevant units---otherwise proper balancing is impossible and an error will be thrown.
Note that excluded units will still be used in Step 1 (e.g. to recover the period FEs) and for pre-trend tests.{p_end}

{phang}{opt minn(#)}: the minimum effective number (i.e. inverse Herfindahl index) of treated observations,
below which a coefficient is suppressed and a warning is issued. 
The inference on coefficients which are based on a small number of observations is unreliable. The default is {opt minn(30)}.
Set to {opt minn(0)} to report all coefficients nevertheless.{p_end}

{phang}{opt autos:ample}: if specified, the observations for which FE cannot be imputed will be automatically dropped from the sample, 
with a warning issued. Otherwise an error will be thrown if any such observations are found.
{opt autosample} cannot be combined with {opt sum} or {opt hbalance};
please specify the sample explicitly if using one of those options and you get an error that imputation has failed (see {help did_imputation##impfails:What if imputation is not possible}).{p_end}

{phang}{opt shift(integer)}: specify to allow for anticipation effects.
The command will pretend that treatment happened {opt shift} periods earlier for each treated unit.{p_end}
{phang2}- Do NOT use this option for pre-trend testing;
use it if anticipation effects are expected in your setting.
(This option {it:can} be used for a placebo test but we recommend a pretrend test instead; see Section 4.4 of Borusyak et al. 2021.){p_end}
{phang2}- The command's output will be labeled relative to the shifted treated date {it:Ei}-shift.
For example, with {opt horizons(0/10)} {opt shift(3)} you will get coeffieints {it:_b[tau0]}...{it:_b[tau10]} where tau{it:h}
is the effect {it:h} periods after the shifted treatment. That is, {it:tau1} corresponds to the average anticipation effect 2 periods before
the actual treatment, while {it:tau8} to the average effect 5 periods after the actual treatment.{p_end}

{phang}{opt pre:trends(integer)}: if some value {it:k}>0 is specified, the command will performs a test for parallel trends,
by a {bf:separate} regression on nontreated observations only: of the outcome on the dummies for 1,...,{it:k} periods before treatment,
in addition to all the FE and controls. The coefficients are reported as {bf:pre}{it:1},...,{bf:pre}{it:k}.
The Wald statistic, pvalue, and degrees-of-freedom as reported in {res:e(pre_chi2)}, {res:e(pre_p)}, and {res:e(pre_df)} resp.{p_end}
{phang2}- Use a reasonable number of pre-trends, do not use all of the available ones unless you have a really large never-treated group. With too many pre-trend coefficients, the power of the joint test will be lower.{p_end}
{phang2}- The entire sample of nontreated observations is always used for pre-trend tests, regardless of {opt hbalance} and other options that restrict the sample for post-treatment effect estimation.{p_end}
{phang2}- The number of pretrend coefficients does not affect the post-treatment effect estimates, which are always computed under the assumption of parallel trends and no anticipation.{p_end}

{dlgtab:Standard errors}

{phang}{opt clus:ter(varname)}: cluster SE within groups defined by this variable. Default is {it:i}. {p_end}

{phang}{opt avgeff:ectsby(varlist)}: Use this option if you have small cohorts of treated observations, and after reviewing Section 4.3
of Borusyak et al. 2021. In brief, SE computation requires averaging the treatment effects by groups of treated observations.{p_end}
{phang2}- These groups should be large enough, so that there is no downward bias from overfitting. {p_end}
{phang2}- But the larger they are, the more conservative SE will be, unless treatment effects are homogeneous within these groups. {p_end}
{phang2}- The varlist in {opt avgeffectsby} defines these groups.{p_end}
{phang2}- The default is cohort-years {opt avgeffectsby(Ei t)}, which is appropriate for large cohorts.{p_end}
{phang2}- With small cohorts, specify coarser groupings; in the extreme, {opt avgeffectsby(D)}. {p_end}
{phang2}- The averages are computed using the "smart" formula from Section 4.3, adjusted for any clustering and any choice of {opt avgeffectsby}. {p_end}

{phang}{opt nose}: do not produce standard errors (much faster).{p_end}

{dlgtab:Miscellaneous}

{phang}{opt save:estimates(newvarname)}: if specified, a new variable will be created storing the estimates of treatment effects for each observation
are stored. The researcher can then construct weighted averages of their interest manually (but without SE). {p_end}
{pmore}{it:Note}: Individual estimates are of course not consistent. But weighted sums of many of them typically are, which is what {cmd:did_imputation} generally reports. {p_end}

{phang}{opt savew:eights}: if specified, new variables {it:__w_*} are generated, storing the weights corresponding to (each) coefficient.
Recall that the imputation estimator is a linear estimator that can be represented as a weighted sum of the outcomes.{p_end}
{phang2}- These weights are applied on top of any {help did_imputation##weights:estimation weights}.{p_end}
{phang2}- For treated observations these weights equal to the corresponding {opt wtr} - that's why the estimator is unbiased
under arbitrary treatment effect heterogeneity.{p_end}
{phang2}- If a weighted average is estimated (i.e. {opt sum} is not specified), the weights add up to one across all treated observations.{p_end}
{phang2}- For diff-in-diffs (i.e. with unit and period FEs), weights add up to zero for every unit and time period.{p_end}

{phang}{opt loadw:eights(varlist)}: use this to speed up the analysis of different outcome variables with an identical specification
on an identical sample. To do so, provide the set of the weight variables (__w*, but can be renamed),
saved using the {opt saveweights} option when running the analysis for the first outcome.
[Warning: the validity of the weights is assumed and not double-checked.]{p_end}

{phang}{opt delta(integer)}: indicates that one period should correpond to {opt delta} steps of {it:t} and {it:Ei}. 
Default is 1, except when the time dimension of the data is set (via {help tsset} or {help xtset});
in that case the default is the corresponding delta.{p_end}

{phang}{opt tol(real)}, {opt maxit(integer)}: tolerance and the maximum number of iterations.
This affects the iterative procedure used to search for the weights underlying the estimator (to produce SE).
Defaults are 10^-6 and 100, resp. If convergence is not achieved otherwise, try increasing them.{p_end}

{phang}{opt verbose}: specify for the debugging mode.{p_end}

{marker weights}{...}
{title:Estimation weights}

{phang} Estimation weights (e.g. {opt aw} but can be {opt iw} or {opt fw}) play two roles: 

{p2col 5 8 8 0 : 1.}Step 1 estimation is done by a weighted regression. This is most efficient when the variance
of the error terms is inversely proportionate to the weights.

{p2col 5 8 8 0 : 2.}In Step 3, the average that defines the estimand is weighted by these weights.
If {opt wtr} is specified explicitly, estimation weights are applied on top of them.{p_end}
{phang2}- If {opt sum} is not specified, the estimand is the average of treatment effects weighted by {opt wtr}*{opt aw} {p_end}
{phang2}- If {opt sum} is specified, the estimand is the sum of treatment effects multiplied by {opt wtr}*{opt aw} {p_end}

{phang} Do NOT specify regression weights if you only have the second motivation to use the weights,
e.g. if you want to measure the ATT weighted by county size but you have no reason to think that the outcomes of larger counties have less noise.
Instead specify the estimand of your interest via {opt wtr}.{p_end}

{phang} All weight types ({opt aw/iw/fw}) produce identical results. Weights should always be non-negative. {p_end}

{marker results}{...}
{title:Stored results}

{synoptset 10 tabbed}{...}
{p2col 5 15 15 2: Matrices}{p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:e(b)}}A row-vector of the estimates and pre-trend coefficients:{p_end}
{pmore3}- If {opt horizons} is specified, the program returns {bf:tau}{it:h} for each {it:h} in the list of horizons.{p_end}
{pmore3}- If multiple {opt wtr} are specified, the program returns {bf:tau_}{it:v} for each {it:v} in the list of {opt wtr} variables. {p_end}
{pmore3}- Otherwise the single returned coefficient is called {bf:tau}. {p_end}
{pmore3}- In addition, if {cmd:pretrends} is specified, the command returns {bf:pre}{it:h} for each pre-trend coefficient {it:h}=1..{opt pretrends}. {p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:e(V)}}Corresponding variance-covariance matrix {p_end}

{marker usage}{...}
{title:Usage Examples}

	{phang}{ul:Conventional panels}{p_end}

    1) Estimate the single average treatment-on-the-treated (ATT) across all treated observations, assuming that FE can be imputed for all treated observations (which is rarely the case)
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei}

    2) Same but dropping the observations for which it cannot be imputed. (After running, investigate that the sample is what you think it is!)
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei, autosample}

    3) Estimate the ATT by horizon
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei, allhorizons autosample}

    4) Estimate the ATT at horizons 0..+6 only
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei, horizons(0/6)}

    5) Estimate the ATT at horizons 0..+6 for the subset of units available for all of these horizons (such that the dynamics are not driven by compositional effects)
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei, horizons(0/6) hbalance}

    6) Include time-varying controls:
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei, controls(w_first w_other*)}

    7) Include state-by-year FE
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y county year Ei, fe(county state#year)}

    8) Drop unit FE
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei, fe(t)}

    9) Additionally report pre-trend coefficients for leads 1,...,5. The estimates for post-treatment effects will NOT change.
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei, horizons(0/6) pretrends(5)}

    10) Estimate the difference between ATE at horizons +2 vs +1 [this can equivalently be done via {help lincom} after estimating ATT by horizon]
        {cmd:. count if K==1}
        {cmd:. gen wtr1 = (K==1)/r(N)}
        {cmd:. count if K==2}
        {cmd:. gen wtr2 = (K==2)/r(N)}
        {cmd:. gen wtr_diff = wtr2-wtr1}
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei, wtr(wtr_diff) sum}

    11) Reduce estimation time by using {opt loadweights} when analyzing several outcomes with identical specifications on identical samples:
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y1 i t Ei, horizons(0/10) saveweights}
        {cmd:. rename __* myweights* // optional}
        {cmd:. did_imputation Y2 i t Ei, horizons(0/10) loadweights(myweights*)}
		
{phang}21) {ul:Repeated cross-sections}: {p_end}
{pmore}When in each period you have a different sample of individiuals {it:i} in the same groups (e.g. regions), 
replace individual FEs with group FEs and consider clustering at the regional level:{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. did_imputation Y i t Ei, fe(region t) cluster(region) ...}{p_end}

{pmore}Note the main parameters still include {it:i}, and not {it:region}, as the unit identifier.{p_end}

{phang}22) {ul:Triple-diffs}: {p_end}
{pmore}When observations are defined by {it:i,g,t} when, say, {it:i} are counties and {it:g} are age groups,
specify a variable {it:ig} identifying the {it:(i,g)} pairs as the unit identifier, add appropriate FEs, and choose your clustering level, e.g.:{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. did_imputation Y ig t Eig, fe(ig i#t g#t) cluster(i) ...}{p_end}

{pmore}Note that the event time {it:Eig} should be specific to the {it:i,g} pairs, not to the {it:i}. For instance, {it:Eig} is missing for a never-treated age group in a county where other groups are treated at some point.{p_end}
