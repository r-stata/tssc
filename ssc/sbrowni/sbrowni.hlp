CACI, August 1998.-Spearman-Brown reliability correction for test length-----------------------------------------------------     ^sbrowni^ #rel0 #count0 #count1     ^sbrowni^ #rel0 #count0 #rel1Description-----------The reliability of a test (Cronbach's alpha or Kuder-Richardson's coefficientin case of dichotomous items) is dependent of the number of items.This immediate command comes in two forms:1. If the reliability is known for a test (#rel0) with any particular number ofitems (#count0), the Spearman-Brown formula can be used to estimate how muchthe reliability would increase if the number of items were increased to#count1.2. The converted formula can be used to estimate the number of items requiredto obtain a particular reliability (#rel1).Examples--------Considering an initial reliability of 0.70 in a 20-item test, the estimatedreliability of a 60-item test is computed by:. ^sbrowni^ .70 20 60Considering an initial reliability of 0.50 in a 20-item test, the estimatednumber of items to achieve a reliability of 0.80 is computed by:. ^sbrowni^ .50 20 .80Also see--------    STB:  ^alpha2^ in sg66 (STB-35)          ^KR20^ Manual:  ^[R] alpha^On-line:  help for @factor@
