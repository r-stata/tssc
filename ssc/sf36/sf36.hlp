.-help for ^sf36^                                      ver 2.2.2 Sept 21, 1999.-Calculation of summary statistics for the SF-36 Health Survey Instrument------------------------------------------------------------------------ ^sf36^ [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] ^, natver^(country abbrev)                            [^stub^(variable prefix)  ^by^(groupvars)                             ^check^ | ^nocheck^                             ^var^lab | ^novar^lab                             ^val^lab | ^noval^lab ]where:  (i)  ^if^ and ^in^ define valid observations for the command. (ii)  ^natver^ requires a string argument specifying the country in         which the data were collected. This is necessary if you wish         to calculate the ^SUMMARY PHYSICAL HEALTH^ and ^SUMMARY MENTAL^         ^HEALTH^ measures in addition to the 8 "traditional" SF-36         measures. The two Summary measures require intermediate data         (means, standard deviations, and factor scores) specific to         each country and usually derived from large national surveys.         The allowed ^country abbrev^s are: ^AUS US UK^.(iii)  ^stub^ requires a ^variable prefix^ to be specified. This is the         common prefix of the 36 variables. If not specified ^sf36^         assumes that your variables have the prefix ^SF36_^. The prefix         is a string whose length must not exceed 5. (iv)  ^check^ implements "manual" range checking. Out-of range data         cause informative messages to be displayed, with the current         observation number and value of each out-of-range value. The         program then terminates, giving the user the opportunity to         check and edit data before reinvoking the program.       ^nocheck^ (default, equivalent to not specifying this option)         implements "automatic" data recoding if out-of-range data         are detected. Out-of-range data are set to missing and ^sf36^         continues execution.  (v)  ^var^lab specifies that the ^original^ 36 variables are given         variable labels defined within the program. Pre-existing         labels in the data are overwritten. These labels follow the         documentation of the SF-36 Australian version. The setting         of ^natver^ does not alter this.       ^novar^lab (default, equivalent to not specifying this option)          prevents any new variable labels being applied to the data. (vi)  ^val^lab specifies that the ^original^ 36 variables are given         value labels defined within the program. Pre-existing         labels in the data are overwritten. These labels follow the         documentation of the SF-36 Australian version. The setting         of ^natver^ does not alter this.       ^noval^lab (default, equivalent to not specifying this option)         prevents any new value labels being applied to the original         variables.       New variables generated by ^sf36^ are given pre-defined       variable and value labels regardless of the status of the       ^var^lab and ^val^lab options.Description-----------^sf36^ is a program for processing SF-36 data using Stata.  The SF-36is a general-purpose health survey instrument published by the MedicalOutcomes Trust. It is comprised of 36 questions in 8 domains. Inaddition, if national weighting data are available, two summarymeasures (PHYSICAL HEALTH and MENTAL HEALTH) may be calculated.What you need:-------------You need a Stata data set with 36 variables corresponding to the 36questions of the SF-36. You may, of course, have additional variables,for example, a case identifier and other demographic variables.The 36 SF-36 question variables ^must^ be named in accordance withthe following rule:Variables in the data set must be named ^<stub>nn$^  where:  ^<stub>^  is the common variable prefix specified as the argument of              the ^stub^ option; if not specified, "SF36_" is assumed;      ^nn^  is the question number given as 2 digits (01 to 11); and       ^$^  is the question part, if any, for example, a b c etc....  Examples:  SF36_03j     SF36_05a             quest04c     quest09b             SFQ11a       SFQ10Important note: The UK version is based on "The UK SF36: An analysis--------------  and interpretation manual" Jenkinson et al, Health                Services Research Unit, Oxford 1996.  This version                changes the original numbering of the US SF36 such                that:           US                         UK           --                         --           question  10      ==>      question  9j           questions 11a-d   ==>      questions 10a-d           Also a goodly number of changes are made to the scoring           algorithm (cf. MOT SF36 Health Survey Scoring Manual).           All these changes are dealt with in ^sf36.ado^.           However, ^sf36.ado^ expects that UK data sets already           have data scored as in pages 49-51 of Jenkinson.  Unlike           the US and Australian case, ^sf36.ado^ does not do any           recoding. This is because the UK SF36 instrument does not           have specified raw data values associated with responses,           but simply ticked boxes which are presumably scored according           to Jenkinson's algorithm at the time of initial data entry.What you get: (assume the stub is the default "SF36_")------------First, ^sf36^ implements range checking according to rules specifiedin the SF-36 Reference and Scoring Manual. (See the ^check^ option).Next, depending on the status of the ^var^lab and ^val^lab options theprogram labels the 36 original variables. It does so according to theAustralian version of the SF-36.  (There are trivial semanticdifferences between countries.)Value labels are named as ^lab_nn(nn)^, for example, lab_11 is thecommon value label for 4 variables SF36_11(a,b,c,d), and lab_0405is the common value label for 7 variables SF36_04(a,b,c,d) andSF36_05(a,b,c).Then the program handles missing data using either means ofnon-missing items or by coding the entire scale as missing forthat subject as prescribed in the SF-36 documentation.57 new variables appear in the data set (the original SF36_nn$variables are untouched).  The 57 comprise:36 new variables (named ^tx_nn$^) represent the original datawith missing data imputed by mean substitutions or by missing valuessubstituted for each item in a scale (as specified in the SF-36 docs).8 new variables represent the untransformed scale scores.1 new variable for the Health Transition scale (a copy of SF36_02)8 new variables represent the corresponding transformed scores.4 new variables associated with the PHYSICAL HEALTH and MENTAL HEALTH  SUMMARY scores.  These are:   2 new variables representing the raw factor scores: raw_PHYS,     raw_MENT (also called AGGregated scores in the SF-36 docs.)   2 new variables representing the standardised scores: std_PHY,     std_MENT (also called the transformed scores, PCS and MCS, in     the SF-36 docs)Calculation of these last 4 variables requires nation-specific datahard-coded into ^sf36.ado^. See discussion of national versions below.The new variables are:  tx_nn$      (nn = 01 to 11; $ = a...j as appropriate)  PF          Physical Functioning  RP          Role Functioning Physical  RE          Role Functioning Emotional  MH          Mental Health  VT          Vitality  BP          Bodily Pain  GH          General Health  SF          Social Functioning  HT          reported Health Transition  PF_trans    Physical Function-transformed  RP_trans    Role Physical-transformed  RE_trans    Role Emotional-tranformed  MH_trans    Mental Health-transformed  VT_trans    Vitality-transformed  BP_trans    Bodily Pain-transformed  GH_trans    General Health-transformed  SF_trans    Social Function-transformed  raw_PHYS    raw factor score (aggregated) for Physical Health  raw_MENT    raw factor score (aggregated) for MentalHealth  std_PHYS    Summary standardised Physical Health/PCS  std_MENT    Summary standardised Mental Health/MCS^sf36^ issues three ^summarize^ commands: the first givessummary statistics for the untransformed scales, the second givesthem for the transformed scales, and the third gives them for the4 physical and mental health summary variables (if data are available).Finally, the program writes a ^note^ to the dataset in memorywarning that new variables generated by ^sf36^ were done soaccording to the current ^if^ and ^in^ conditions. This warningis echoed to the display. The original 36 variables areunchanged.National data-------------US data are documented in "SF-36 Physical & Mental Health SummaryScales: A user's manual"  Ware, Health Assessment Lab 1994.Australian data are from the 1995 National Health Survey, AustralianBureau of Statistics.UK data are from the OHLS as documented in "The UK SF36: an analysisand interpretation manual" Jenkinson et al, Dept Primaty Care andPublic Health Oxford 1996 (and errata page).Examples--------Variables have prefix "SF36_"; out-of-range values handled manually;Australian data to be used for PHYSICAL and MENTAL HEALTH summarystatistics; program supplies variable labels and value labels;summary statistics are produced for all data combined and for each ofthe states of the Commonwealth: . ^sf36^ ^using^ mydata, ^check^ ^var^ ^val^ ^natver^(AUS) ^by^(state)Variables have prefix "sf36Q"; out-of-range values handledautomatically; US data to be used for PHYSICAL and MENTALHEALTH summary statistics; program does not label original 36variables; new variables and summary statistics only on males: . ^sf36^ ^using^ mysf36 ^if^ sex=="M", ^stub(^sf36Q^)^ ^natver(^US^)^Variables have prefix "SF36_"; out-of-range values handledautomatically; program supplies value labels, but notvariable labels; Australian data used for Summary scales: . ^sf36^ ^using^ sf36test, ^nocheck^ ^val^ ^natver^(AUS)(screen output now follows:)^Note^^----^All new variables in the data set were constructed under the qualifiers:   if: ^no if condition^   in: ^no in condition^Observations on the new variables not satisfying these criteria will beset to missing. Observations on original ^SF36_nn$^ vars are unchanged.A ^note^ to this effect has been  written to the data in memory.^Raw scale statistics^^--------------------^Variable |     Obs        Mean   Std.
