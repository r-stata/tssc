This should save developers some time asthe helpfiles are not exactly WYSIWYG.{pstd}Now allows text to be inserted in the original ado-file that contains the title, description, options, see also, examples,emails and institutes. The commented text must start with START HELP FILE and end with END HELP FILE. There are varioustext boxes such as title[] which contains the text for the title. Note do not use [ or ] in the text descriptor. Similarlythe description text is within desc[ ], etc.. An example is below that generates all the text required in a help file.{pstd}Avoid using the text `mh_line' in your code as this will create an infinite loop.{pstd}If you comment out a line of code with the return statements then this program will still pick themup and think you are trying to return something .e.g  /*return local whatever ="3" */.It is possible to handle this problem internally but would make the resulting code too slow so better to remove code that is not needed.{pstd}Note: occasionally there is a need to allow special characters e.g. : in the examples section executable lines, for this use char 58 in brackets (thanks to Adrian Sayers for  this tip).{asis}/* START HELP FILEtitle[a command to give the parameters of the single stage Gehan design]desc[ {cmd:sampsi_gehan} calculates the sample sizes for the first and second stages of the Gehan design    (1961).]opt[beta() specifies the first stage maximum probability of seeing no responses.]opt[p1() specifies the desired probability of response.]opt[se()  specifies the desired standard error in the second stage.]opt[start() specifies the smallest n to start the search from.]opt[precp() specifies the probability used in the standard error formula.]opt2[precp() specifies the probability used in the standard error formula.and I wanted more than one line for the longer  descriptions of theoption precp() later in the help file]example[ {stata sampsi_gehan, p1(0.2) beta(0.05) se(0.1) precp(0.4)}]author[Prof Adrian Mander]institute[Cardiff University]email[mandera@cardiff.ac.uk]return[n1 The first stage sample size]return[p1 The interesting p1 ]return[beta The type 2 error]return[se Standard error]return[n2 The second stage sample size]freetext[]references[Gehan, E.A.
