Note, use only a    single character if you wish to allow the maximum number of digits for use    in representing the categories -- 6 digits.Options- -------^nodrop^ indicates that the first indicator variable *NOT* be dropped from    the set of generated variables.  This option creates a set of indicators    that fully span the space and are collectively collinear.^full^ indicates that indicators should be generated for all combinations of    the two variables, even if the indicator is constant for a combination.^index^ specifies that the "index" values of the categories be used in naming    the indicator variable rather than the values of the variable.  For    example, if ^cat1^ takes on the values 1, 2, 5, 6 and "D" were specified    on the ^gen()^ option; the indicator variables would normally start    with D1... , D2..., D3...., D5...., D6.... .  With the ^index^ option,    the indicators would be named D1... , D2..., D3...., D4...., D5.... .Examples- --------    . intterms mpg foreign, gen(D)    . intterms mpg foreign, gen(ivar) indexAuthor- ------     Vince Wiggins     StataCorp.     vwiggins@@stata.comAlso see- -------- Manual:  ^[U] 26 Estimation and post-estimation commands^          ^[U] 35 Overview of model estimation^          ^[R] xi^On-line:  ^[R] xi^,  help for any estimation command
