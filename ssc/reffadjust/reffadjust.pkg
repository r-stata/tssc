d 'REFFADJUST': module  to estimate adjusted regression coefficients for the association between two random effects variables
d
"d     reffadjust provides two postestimation commands,"
"d reffadjustsim and   reffadjust4nlcom, to estimate adjusted"
d regression coefficients for the   association between two random
d effects variables and their confidence intervals   after random
d effect models. The commands work with models fit via the
"d -runmlwin- Stata package which fits models in MLwiN, and after"
"d Stataâ€™s   -mixed-/-xtmixed-, -meqrlogit-/-xtmelogit-, and"
d -meqrpoisson-/-xtmepoisson- commands.
