*! version 1.0.0   01oct1997* This program takes a varlist and creates variables corresponding to* the squares and cross products of the included variables.  The names* of the new variables are created by simply combining the names of* the variables used to create the new variables.  This means that* only variables with names of length 4 or less are allowed.program define allcross	version 5.0	local varlist "req ex min(1)"	parse "`*'"	parse "`varlist'", parse(" ")	preserve	/* check for long names */	local i 1	while "``i''" != "" {		if length("``i''") > 4 {			di in red "variable name lengths must be < 5"			exit 198		}		local i = `i' + 1	}	/* now form cross terms */	local i 1	while "``i''" != "" {		local j `i'		while "``j''" != "" {			gen ``i''``j'' = ``i'' * ``j''			local j = `j' + 1		}		local i = `i' + 1	}	restore, notend
