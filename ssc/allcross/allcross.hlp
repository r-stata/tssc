..-help for ^allcross^                          (statalist distribution Oct 1, 1997)..-All cross-products and squares- ------------------------------	^allcross^ varlistDescription- -----------^allcross^ creates variables corresponding to the cross-products and squares ofthe variables in varlist.  The names of the created variables are formed byconcatenating the names in varlist involved in the cross-product term.  Sincevariable names are limited to 8 characters an error occurs if varlist containsvariables with names longer than 4 characters.Examples- --------	. ^allcross x1 x2 x3^	. ^allcross x1-x4 age y1-y3^Note- ----The user should be aware that when ^allcross^ is given a large number of variables in the varlist that it will end up creating a very large number of variables in the user's working data set.  For example, if the user has 30variables in her data set and executes ^allcross _all^, she will then have30+(30*31)/2 = 495 variables in her data set.Author- ------	Kenneth Higbee	Stata Corp.	khigbee@@stata.com
