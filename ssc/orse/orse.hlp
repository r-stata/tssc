It also saves the standard errors of the odds ratios. These statistics are displayed on the output if the or option is used in {cmd:logit, ologit},but are not otherwise accessible. {cmd:orse} saves these statistics as Stata matrices {cmd:or} and{cmd:orse}.{p}If the only concern is to produce tabulated results of the odds ratios and theirstandard errors, they can be produced with {bind:{cmd: estout, cells(b se(par)) style(fixed) drop(_cons) eform}.}{title:Options}{p 0 4}{cmd:add(}{it:string}{cmd:)} requests that the odds ratios and their standard errorsbe added to the set of stored estimates named {it:string} as {cmd:e(or)} and {cmd:e(orse)},respectively. This option requires thatBen Jann's {cmd:estout} package is installed, as it uses the {cmd:estadd} and {cmd:eststo}commands from that package. After {cmd:orse} is executed, you may use {cmd:estout}to display a results table containing the odds ratios and their standard errors. {title:Examples}{p 8 12}{stata "sysuse auto" : . sysuse auto}{p 8 12}{stata " logit foreign weight turn length, or":. logit foreign weight turn length, or}{p 8 12}{stata "orse":. orse}{p 8 12}{stata "mat list or":. mat list or}{p 8 12}{stata "mat list orse":. mat list orse}{p 8 12}{stata "ologit rep78 weight turn length, or":. ologit rep78 weight turn length, or}{p 8 12}{stata "orse, add(test1)":. orse, add(test1)}{p 8 12}{stata "estout test1, cells(or orse(par)) style(fixed) drop(_cons)":. estout test1, cells(or orse(par)) style(fixed) drop(_cons)}{title:Acknowledgements}	I thank Nicola Lostumbo for suggesting the need for this routine, and	providing details of the necessary computations. I am indebted to Ben Jann	for providing the very useful estadd and eststo routines as 	adjuncts to estout.{title:Author}	Christopher F Baum, Boston College, USA	baum@bc.edu{title:Also see}{p 1 14}Manual:  {hi:[R] logit, ologit}{p_end}{p 0 19}On-line:  help for {help logit}; {help ologit} {p_end}
