{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:motivatedolly} pulls from Dolly's enormous discography spanning over half a decade, plus her famous one-liners, to help us make it through tough times. Song lyrics include a link to youtube where you can listen to the song for some musical 
inspiration. The advanced option includes links to Bedtime with Dolly, a quarantine-era video series of Dolly reading inspirational selections from her Imagination Library. Imagination Library is a charity started by Dolly Parton which sends free, 
age-appropriate books to children each month so that "all children [can] grow up in a home full of books." Here's a {browse  "https://imaginationlibrary.com/news-resources/research/":link} to all the research evaluating the impact of her charity.

{pstd}
{cmd:motivatedolly} was built upon the ideas and code of several good-humored members of the Stata community, including

{phang}{browse "https://econpapers.repec.org/software/bocbocode/s458565.htm":motivate}, from Kabira Namit, who to the best of my knowledge spearheaded the field of fun stata packages.
 
{phang}{browse "https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458576.html":demotivate}, by Kevin Denny, who provided "a much needed antithesis to Kabira Namitâ€™s motivate package".{p_end}
