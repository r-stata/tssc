.-help for ^rglm^.-Generalized linear models with robust variance estimates---------------------------------------------------------	^rglm^  [varlist] [weight] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]                [^,^  ^cl^uster^(^varname^)^ ^ms^pec ^td^ist minus(#)                glm-options ]Description------------^rglm^ fits generalized linear models and calculates a Huber (sandwich)estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of estimates. It can be used alone or called without arguments after a previous call to ^glm^. Aswith other  "robust" commands, the units may be considered to fall intoclusters.Options for use with ^rglm^--------------------------^cluster(^varname^)^ specifies the variable which defines samplingclusters.^mspec^ specifies that full Huber variances be used. These are robust tomis-specification of conditional means. If ^mspec^ is absent, semi-Hubervariances are calculated, robust to variance mis-specification caused byoverdispersion, underdispersion, heteroscedasticity and clustering,but assuming that conditional means are specified correctly by themodel.(Except in the case of canonical link functions, where the semi-Hubervariance is the full Huber variance. See Section 2.5 of McCullagh andNelder (1989).)^tdist^ specifies that P-values and confidence intervals are to becalculated assuming estimates to have a t-distribution with M-kdegrees of freedom, where k is the number of model parameters, and M isthe number of clusters if ^cluster^ is specified, or the number ofobservations if ^cluster^ is not specified.^minus(^#^)^ specifies the ^minus^ parameter to pass to ^_robust^, toapply a finite-sample adjustment to the Huber covariance matrix. Ifabsent (or negative), it is reset to k (the number of model parameters).If a varlist is supplied, then all ^glm^ options are allowed. If not,then the only ^glm^ options allowed are ^level^ and ^eform^, and^cluster^, ^mspec^, ^tdist^ and ^minus^ are ignored.Examples--------- . ^glm dead ln_dose, family(binomial ntest) link(logit)^ . ^rglm, ms^ . ^rglm dead ln_dose, family(binomial ntest) link(logit)^ . ^rglm dead ln_dose, family(binomial ntest) link(logit) clust(group)^Author-------Roger Newson, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK.Email: ^r.newson@@ic.ac.uk^Acknowledgment---------------This program was based on a previous version called hglm, whichcalculated semi-Huber variances, and was kindly supplied to theauthor by David Clayton of MRC in Cambridge, England.Also see---------Manual:  ^[R] glm, [R] _robust^References-----------McCullagh, P. and J.
