You must ^tsset^ your data beforeusing ^wntstmvq^; see help @tsset@. The sample may not contain gaps.varlist may contain time-series operators; see help @varlist@.Description-----------^wntstmvq^ performs the multivariate Ljung-Box portmanteau (or Q) test forwhite noise in a set of timeseries. This test is a generalization of theunivariate Ljung-Box portmanteau (Q) test implemented in Stata as ^wntestq^.The multivariate form of the test is described in Lutkepohl (1993).The null hypothesis of the multivariate test is that the autocorrelationfunctions of all series in ^varlist^ have no significant elements for lags1-^lags^. The ^lags^ parameter may be specified by the user. If the seriesin ^varlist^ are residuals from a vector autoregression, the ^varlags^ optionshould be specified to provide the order of the VAR. Under the nullhypothesis, the test statistic is distributed Chi-squared with degrees offreedom equal to p^^2 (^lags^-^varlags^) where p is the number of series in^varlist^. A rejection indicates that at least one series is not white noise.Although portmanteau statistics are commonly applied in diagnosing time seriesmodels, some caution should be exercised with their use in a cointegrationcontext. Jacobson (1995, p. 179) states "[O]ne should exercise some care whenusing the portmanteau statistic for evaluating the fit of a cointegration model. This observation is due to the facts that cointegration implies thepresence of unit roots and an assumption underlying the properties of theportmanteau statistic is that of a stationary process disqualifying roots onthe unit circle. There is to my knowledge no theoretical result justifying theuse of portmanteau statistics in connection with potential unit roots.Nevertheless these tests are being used..."Options-------^lags(^#^)^ specifies the maximum lag order to be used in the test. If notspecified, It takes on a default value of min(N/2-2,40) where N is the numberof observations available.^varlags(^#^)^ specifies the order of the VAR (vector autoregression) usedto produce the series in ^varlist^. If provided, ^varlags^ must notexceed ^lags^.Examples--------	. ^wntstmvq eps1 eps2 eps3 eps4^		. ^wntstmvq eps1 eps2 eps3 eps4, lags(24)^			. ^wntstmvq eps1 eps2 eps3 eps4, lags(24) varlags(4)^References----------Jacobson, T. 1995.
