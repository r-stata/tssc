d 'SWPERMUTE': module to compute Permutation tests for Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomised Trials
d
d  Permutation tests are useful in stepped-wedge trials to provide
d robust statistical tests of intervention-effect estimates.
"d However, the Stata command permute does not produce valid tests"
d in this setting because individual observations are not
d exchangeable. We introduce the swpermute command that permutes
d clusters to sequences to maintain exchangeability. The command
d provides additional functionality to aid users in performing
"d analyses of stepped-wedge trials. In particular, we include the"
"d option â€œwithinperiod"" that performs the specified analysis"
d separately in each period of the study and the resulting
d period-specific intervention-effect estimates are combined as a
d weighted average.
