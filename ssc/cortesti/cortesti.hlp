.-help for ^cortesti^by Herve M. CACI, October 2000.-Test of equality of two correlation coefficients------------------------------------------------     ^cortesti^ #corr1 #n1 #corr2 #n2     ^cortesti^ #rxy #rxv #rvy #nDescription-----------In standard tests for correlation, a correlation coefficient is testedtested against the hypothesis of no correlation, i.e. R=0. However it ispossible to test whether the correlation coefficient is equal to ordifferent from another fixed value.There are situations where you would like to know whether a certaincorrelation strength is really different from another one.In the first form, ^cortesti^ compares two coefficients computed fromtwo different samples (n1 and n2 are the respective sizes of the samples).This test is only an approximation, and should only be used when bothsamples are larger than 10.In the second form, ^cortesti^ compares two coefficients Ñ i.e. r(x,y)and r(v,y) Ñ computed in a single sample using a third coefficient, r(x,v).The sample size is the fourth argument.Examples--------. ^cortesti^ .84 63 .75 42Test of equality of two correlation coefficientsdrawn from the two different samples------------------------------------------------Coefficient 1 = 0.840 (n1 =     63)Coefficient 2 = 0.750 (n2 =     42)Ho: coefficient 1 = coefficient 2         z =   1.207Prob > |z| =   0.2275. ^cortesti^ .45 .35 .65 200Comparison of correlation coefficientsdrawn from the same sample (n =    200 obs)-------------------------------------------Coefficient r(x,y) = 0.450Coefficient r(x,v) = 0.350Coefficient r(v,y) = 0.650t =  -3.162 (df=   197)Ha: r(x,y) < r(v,y) --- P < t = 0.001Ha: r(x,y) = r(v,y) --- P = t = 0.002Ha: r(x,y) > r(v,y) --- P > t = 0.999Also see--------Book:  Cohen J. & Cohen P.
