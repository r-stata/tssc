{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt eventstudyweights} estimate weights underlying two-way fixed effects regressions with relative time indicators, 
It is optimized for speed in large panel datasets thanks to {helpb hdfe}.

{pstd}
To estimate the dynamic effects of an absorbing treatment, researchers often use two-way fixed effects regressions that include leads and lags of the treatment (event study specification). Units are categorized into different cohorts based on their initial treatment timing. Sun and Abraham (2020) show the coefficients in this event study specification can be written as a linear combination of cohort-specific effects from both its own relative period and other relative periods. 
{opt eventstudyweights} is a Stata module that estimates these weights for any given event study specification.  

{pstd}
For each relative time indicator specified in {it:rel_time_list}, {opt eventstudyweights} estimates the weights 
underlying the linear combination of treatment effects in its associated coefficients using
an auxiliary regression. It provides built-in options to control for fixed effects and covariates
(see {help eventstudyweights##syntax:Controls}).    {cmd:eventstudyweights} exports these weights to a spreadsheet that can be analyzed separately.
 This spreadsheet also contains the cohort and relative time each weight corresponds to, with headers as specified in {opt cohort()} and {opt rel_time()}.


{dlgtab:Main}

{marker by_notes}{...}
{phang}{opth cohort(varname)} is a categorical varaible that contains the   initial treatment timing of each unit.

{phang}{opth rel_time(varname)} is a categorical varaible that contains the the relative time for each unit at each calendar time.

{pmore}
Users should shape their dataset to a long format where each observation is at the unit-time level. Users should prepare the cohort and relative time variables as illustrated in the example.

{pstd}Suppose we will later use a specification with lead=2 and lag=0,1,2 to estimate the dynamic effect of union status on income.  We first generate these relative time indicators.{p_end}

{pstd} For the coefficient associate with each of the above relative time indicators in a two-way fixed effects regression, we can estimate the weights and export to a spreadsheet "weights.xlsx".{p_end}
