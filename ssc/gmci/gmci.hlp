When specified, the level parameter, ^#^, ^must be an integer     from 10 to 99^.      The default value is ^95^ (%).^a^dd(#) allows a specified value to be added to all variables in varlistprior     to calculating the geometric mean and confidence interval. This is handy     when there are nonpositive values.^o^nly has no effect unless the -add- option is used.  When both optionsare specified,     the -add- option will only be applied to variables that havenonpositive values.Saved results- -------------The command stores the following statistics in global macros:    ^S_1^ - number of observations    ^S_3^ - geometric mean    ^S_5^ - lower bound of confidence interval    ^S_6^ - upper bound of confidence intervalN.B.: when several variables are specified in a single command line, theabove macros retain the values for the ^last^ variable ^in the list^.Authors- -------John Carlin <carlin@@cryptic.rch.unimelb.edu.au>Suzanna Vidmar <vidmars@@cryptic.rch.unimelb.edu.au>     (Royal Children's Hospital and University of Melbourne,     Melbourne, Australia)Carlos Ramalheira <cramal@@cygnus.ci.uc.pt>    (Coimbra University Hospital, Coimbra, Portugal)Based on original contributions byWilliam Gould <wgould@@stata.com> and Nick Cox <N.J.Cox@@durham.ac.uk>.
