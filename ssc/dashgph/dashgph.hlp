 .-help for ^dashgph^					 .-Allow dashed lines in scatterplots----------------------------------^dashgph^ varlist [weight] [if ^exp^] [in ^range^]           [, ^D^ash(numlist) ^SPAC^e(numlist) <usual graph options> ]Description-----------^dashgph^ is a wrapper program for ^graph, twoway^ which adds the abilityto connect points with a dashed line, by using ^c^onnect^(^D^)^. The relativesize of the dashes and space between the dashes can be controlled, or set automatically by the program.The usual syntax for ^graph^ applies, with the addition of the ^D^ identifierto the ^c^onnect() option.^dashgph^ only works for twoway scatterplots.  The jitter and xreverse are notallowed, and options that specify a right-hand scale (rscale and rescale) onlywork correctly when the dashed lines connect variables scaled on the right-hand axis.Options-------^dash(^numlist^)^ specifies the length of the dashes, in virtual pixels.    If one value is specified, that length is used for all dashed lines.    If no value is specified, the first dashed line is drawn with length=200,    and for each subsequent line the length is increased by 200.    ^space(^numlist^)^ indicates the amount of space between dashes, as a percentage    of the dash length. The default is 100 for all series.^connect(^c...c^)^ specifies if points are to be connected. The usual options    are valid (see help ^grsym^), as well as ^D^, which indicates a dashed line.    Remarks-------This command draws on programming logic from Michael Blasnik's ^dashln^.Examples-------- 	. ^dashgph price mpg, c(D)^	. ^dashgph price weight mpg, c(lD)^              	. ^dashgph price weight mpg, c(DD) dash(200 1000) space(100 50) ylab^              Author------    Nicholas Winter, University of Michigan    nwinter@@umich.eduAlso see--------On-line:  ^help^ for @gph@, @graph@
