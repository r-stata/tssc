The best model, then,minimizes the criterion. The three informational measures differ in thepenalty term, SBIC penalizing more severely for larger samples, and ICOMPaccounting for covariance structure of a model (and, thus, forcollinearity between the factors and dependence among the parameterestimates). Options -------^rss^ specifies that the criteria are to be calculated from the residual        sum of squares, rather that directly from the likelihood function        (if the latter is unavailable). Author ------Stas Kolenikov, skolenik@@[recep.glasnet.ru, nes.cemi.rssi.ru, yahoo.com] See also ---------On-line: help for @est@, @postest@, @arimafit@ (if installed), @fitstat@ (if installed) Manual: ^[U] 23 Estimation and post-estimation commands^ References ----------Akaike, H.
