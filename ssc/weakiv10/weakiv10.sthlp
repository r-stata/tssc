{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt weakiv10} performs a set of tests of the coefficient(s) on the endogenous variable(s)
in an instrumental variables (IV) model,
and constructs confidence sets for these coefficients.
These tests and confidences are robust to weak instruments
in the sense that identification of the coefficients is not assumed.
This is in contrast to the traditional IV/GMM estimation methods,
where the validity of tests on estimated coefficients requires the assumption that they are identified.

{pstd}
{opt weakiv10} can be used to estimate linear (including panel fixed effects and first diffences),
probit and tobit IV models with one or two endogenous regressors.
{opt weakiv10} supports a range of variance-covariance estimators for linear IV models
including heteroskedastic-, autocorrelation-, and one- and two-way cluster-robust VCEs.
{opt weakiv10} also provides graphics options that allow the plotting of
confidence intervals and rejection probabilities (one endogenous regressor),
and confidence regions and rejection surfaces (two endogenous regressors).

{pstd}
{opt weakiv10} can be used either as a standalone estimator
where the user provides the specification of the model,
or after previous IV estimation by {helpb ivregress}, {helpb ivreg2}, {helpb ivreg2h},
{helpb xtivreg}, {helpb xtivreg2}, {helpb ivprobit}, or {helpb ivtobit}.

{pstd}
When used as a standalone estimator,
{opt weakiv10} works by calling {helpb ivregress}, {helpb ivreg2}, {helpb ivreg2h},
{helpb xtivreg}, {helpb xtivreg2}, {helpb ivprobit}, or {helpb ivtobit}
depending what the user has specified as {it:iv_cmd}.
{opt weakiv10} passes all user-specified model estimation options
to the estimation command:
variable lists, VCE specification, estimation method, etc.

{pstd}
When used with a model previously estimated by
{helpb ivregress}, {helpb ivreg2}, {helpb ivreg2h},
{helpb xtivreg}, {helpb xtivreg2}, {helpb ivprobit}, or {helpb ivtobit},
{opt weakiv10} obtains the model specification from the previous estimation.
This is either the model currently in memory,
or the stored model provided by the user in {opt usemodel(name)}.

{pstd}
{opt weakiv10} also supports Stata {it:replay} syntax.
If the {opt weakiv10} results are the current estimation in memory,
{opt weakiv10} with no model specified will replay them.
This can be used to tweak the graph options
without {opt weakiv10} having to recalculate the full set of estimation results (see below).

{pstd}
For linear IV estimation including panel fixed effects and first differences,
{opt weakiv10} supports all the variance-covariance estimation options available
with {helpb ivregress}, {helpb ivreg2}, {helpb ivreg2h}, {helpb xtivreg} and {helpb xtivreg2}.
When used with {helpb ivreg2h}
(IV estimation using heteroskedasticity-based instruments)
the {opt gen} option of {helpb ivreg2h} is required
in order to generate the new instruments;
see {helpb ivreg2h}.
For IV probit and IV tobit estimation,
{opt weakiv10} supports only variance-covariance estimation options that assume
homoskedasticity (that is, all variance-covariance options except
{cmd:vce(robust)} and {cmd:vce(cluster} {it:clustvar}{cmd:)}).
For IV probit estimation,
{opt weakiv10} supports only estimation using Newey's (1987) two-step estimator,
and the {opt twostep} option is required;
see help {helpb ivprobit}.
Weights that are supported by each IV command are also supported by {opt weakiv10}.

{pstd}
{opt weakiv10} requires {helpb avar} (Baum and Schaffer 2013) to be installed.
The graphing options for the 2-endogenous-regressor case require Stata 12 or higher
for the contour plots of confidence regions,
and require version 1.06 or higher of (helpb surface} (Mander 2005)
for the 3-D plots of rejection surfaces.
{opt weakiv10} will prompt the user for installation of
{helpb avar} and {helpb surface} if necessary.
{helpb avar} is an essential component and {opt weakiv10} will not run without it.
Neither {helpb graph contour} nor {helpb surface} is an essential component;
{opt weakiv10} will run but will not provide the corresponding graphs.

{marker tests}{...}
{title:Tests, confidence intervals, rejection probabilities}

{pstd}
{opt weakiv10} calculates minimum distance (MD) or Lagrange multiplier (LM)
versions of weak-instrument-robust tests of the coefficient
on the endogenous variable {it:beta} in an instrumental variables (IV) estimation.
In an exactly-identified model where the number of instruments
equals the number of endogenous regressors,
it reports the Anderson-Rubin ({it:AR}) test statistic.
When the IV model contains more instruments than endogenous regressors
(the model is overidentified),
{opt weakiv10} also conducts the conditional likelihood ratio ({it:CLR}) test,
the Lagrange multiplier {it:K} test, the {it:J} overidentification test,
and a combination of the {it:K} and overidentification tests ({it:K-J}).
The default behavior of {opt weakiv10} is to report MD versions of these tests;
for linear models, these are equivalent to Wald-type tests.
{opt weakiv10} can optionally report instead LM-type versions of
the {it:AR}, {it:K}, {it:J} and {it:K-J} tests.
In the current implementation of {opt weakiv10},
the {it:CLR} test is available for the 1-endog-regressor case only.
For reference, {opt weakiv10} also reports a Wald test
using the relevant traditional IV parameter and VCE estimators.

{pstd}
The {it:AR} test is a joint test of the structural parameter
({it:beta=b0}, where {it:beta} is the coefficient on the endogenous regressor)
and the exogeneity of the instruments
({it:E(Zu)=0}, where {it:Z} are the instruments
and {it:u} is the disturbance in the structural equation).
The {it:AR} statistic can be decomposed into the {it:K} statistic
(which tests only {it:H0:beta=b0},
assuming the exogeneity conditions {it:E(Zu)=0} are satisfied)
and the {it:J} statistic
(which tests only {it:H0:E(Zu)=0},
assuming that {it:beta=b0} is true).
This {it:J} statistic is evaluated at the null hypothesis,
as opposed to the Hansen {it:J} statistic from GMM estimation,
which is evaluated at the parameter estimate.

{pstd}
The {it:CLR} test is a related approach to testing {it:H0:beta=b0}.
It has good power properties,
and in particular is the most powerful test for the linear model under homoskedasticity
(within a class of invariant similar tests).
An important advantage of the {it:CLR} test over the {it:K} test is that
the {it:K} test can lose power in some regions of the parameter space
when the objective function has a local extremum or inflection point;
the {it:CLR} test does not suffer from this problem.

{pstd}
The {it:K-J} test combines the {it:K} and {it:J} statistics to jointly test
the structural parameter and the overidentifying restrictions.
It is more efficient than the {it:AR} test and allows different weights or test levels
to be put on the parameter and overidentification hypotheses.
Unlike the {it:K} test when used on its own,
the {it:K-J} test does not suffer from the problem of spurious power losses.
To perform the {it:K-J} test, the researcher specifies
the significance levels {it:alpha_K} and {it:alpha_J} for
the {it:K} and {it:J} statistics.
Because the {it:K} and {it:J} tests are independent,
the null of the {it:K-J} test is rejected
if either {it:p_K}<{it:alpha_K}
or {it:p_J}<{it:alpha_J},
where {it:p_K} and {it:p_J} are the {it:K} and {it:J} p-values, respectively.
The overall size of the {it:K-J} test is given by (1-(1-{it:alpha_K})*(1-{it:alpha_J})).

{pstd}
The default behavior of {opt weakiv10} is for the user to choose
the overall size of the {it:K-J} test
and the weights {it:kwt} and (1-{it:kwt}) to put on
the {it:K} and {it:J} components, respectively.
Alternatively, the user may specify
the separate significance levels {it:alpha_K} and {it:alpha_J},
from which the overall {it:K-J} test size and weights are calculated.
The p-value function for the {it:K-J} test is
{it:p=min(p1,p2)}, where
{it:p1=(p_K/kwt)*(1-(1-kwt)*p_K)} and
{it:p2=(p_J/(1-kwt))*(1-kwt*p_J)}.
For large {it:L%} (e.g., 95%),
this is approximately equivalent to
rejecting the null at the {it:(100-L)%} significance level if
{it:K} is greater than the {it:kwt*(100-L)%} critical value or
{it:J} is greater than the {it:(1-kwt)*(100-L)%} critical value.
For example, if {it:kwt}=0.8 and {it:(100-L)}=5%,
then the text rejects if the p-value for the {it:K} test is below 4%
or the p-value for the {it:J} test is below 1%
(because (1-(1-0.04)*(1-0.01))=0.0496 which is approximately 0.05).

{pstd}
For the single-endogenous-regressor case,
{opt weakiv10} also inverts these tests to obtain and report
weak-instrument-robust confidence intervals and
(with the {opt graph(.)} option),
the corresponding rejection probabilities.
In a graph of rejection probabilities,
an L% confidence interval is readily visualized
as the range of values for {it:b0}
such that the rejection probability for the statistic
lies below a horizontal line drawn at L%.
In the case of estimation of the linear model under the assumption of homoskedasticity and independence,
{opt weakiv10} uses a closed-form solution for these confidence intervals.
In all other specifications,
{opt weakiv10} estimates confidence intervals by grid search.

{pstd}
For the 2-endogenous-regressors case,
{opt weakiv10} uses a grid search and graphical methods
to report the corresponding confidence regions
and rejection probabilities.
In this case, the rejection probabilities form a 3-D rejection surface
where {it:beta1}, the coefficient on endogenous regressor 1, is plotted against the x-axis,
{it:beta2}, the coefficient on endogenous regressor 2, is plotted against the y-axis,
and the rejection probability is plotted against the z-axis (vertical axis).
An L% confidence region is the set of values
for {it:b1} and {it:b2} such that
the null hypothesis {it:H0:beta1=b1 and beta2=b2} cannot be rejected.
In a 3-D graph of the rejection probability surface,
an L% confidence region is readily visualized
as the range of values for {it:b1} and {it:b2}
such that the rejection surface lies below a horizontal plane drawn at L%.

{pstd}
A special case arises when there are 2 endogenous regressors,
but one coefficient is weakly identified and one is strongly identified.
{opt weakiv10} supports this via the {opt strong(.)} option;
the option is available for linear models only.
By convention, the weakly-identified endogenous coefficient is #1
and the strongly-identified endogenous coefficient is #2.
Testing in this case follows the method of Kleibergen (2004);
see Mikusheva (2013) for a concise description.
For a given hypothesized value for the weakly-identified coefficient,
the method first estimates the strongly-identified coefficient
using an efficient estimator
(2SLS in the i.i.d. case or 2-step efficient GMM in the non-i.i.d. case),
and then calculates the test statistic
using the same expressions as for the 2-endogenous-regressor case,
the hypothesized value for the weakly-identified coefficient,
but the estimated value for the strongly-identified coefficient.
To obtain confidence intervals and rejection probabilities,
the procedure is repeated for each hypothesized value
of the weakly-identified coefficient.
Testing, graphing and other options follow the syntax
for the 1-endogenous-regressor case.

{pstd}
{marker method}{...}
The default tests implemented by {opt weakiv10} are the Magnusson (2010) minimum-distance (MD) versions of
the weak-identification-robust tests introduced by
Anderson and Rubin (1949),
Kleibergen (2002, 2005) and Moreira (2003).
For the linear models supported by {opt weakiv10},
including the panel data fixed effects and first differences models,
the MD versions are equivalent to Wald versions of these tests.
When the {it:lm} options is specified,
{opt weakiv10} reports the Kleibergen (2002, 2005) LM versions
of the {it:AR}, {it:K}, {it:J} and {it:K-J} tests for linear models
(and the Kleibergen (2005) GMM generalization of Moreira's CLR statistic
for non-iid linear models only).
In the construction of the LM versions of the tests,
any exogenous regressors are first partialled out.
For further discussion of these tests,

{marker interpretation1}{...}
{title:Summary interpretations of {it:weakiv10} output: 1 endogenous regressor}

{pstd}
The following summarizes what the various statistics assume and test
in the single-endogenous-regressor case, and how to interpret the results.
The interpretations are similar for the 2-endogenous-regressor case
when only one coefficient is weakly identified.
The structural parameter, {it:beta}, is the coefficient on the endogenous regressor;
{it:b0} is a hypothesized value for {it:beta};
the excluded instruments are {it:Z};
the assumption that the instruments are exogenous is {it:E(Zu)=0}.
Roughly speaking,
a well-specified model is one in which
{it:H0:beta=b0} cannot be rejected for a narrow range of hypothesized values {it:b0}
(i.e., {it:beta} is precisely estimated}
and the assumption of instrument exogeneity
cannot be rejected for a wide range of hypothesized values {it:b0}
(i.e., the exogeneity assumption is generally satisified).

{marker cset}{...}
{pstd}
An {it:L%} confidence interval is
the range of {it:b0} such that the rejection probability (=1-{it:pvalue}) is below {it:L%}.
Users can use the {it:graph(.)} option to plot rejection probabilities.
The confidence intervals reported by {opt weakiv10} can, in overdidentified models,
be empty, disjoint (composed of unconnected segments), open-ended,
or cover the entire range of possible values for {it:beta}.
An empty confidence interval (null set) means there is no possible value {it:b0}
that is consistent with the model;
this is an indication of misspecification when {it:L%} is fairly high.
Disjoint confidence intervals arise when the plot of the rejection probability
dips below {it:L%} in more than one range;
an example is when the {it:K} statistic has inflection points or local minima
that cause spurious power losses
(inspection of a graph of the {it:K} rejection probability is a way of detecting this).
Open-ended confidence intervals commonly arise when the grid
does not extend far enough to capture the point where the rejection probability
crosses above the {it:L%} line.
Interpretation of an {it:L%} confidence interval that covers
the entire grid range of possible values for {it:beta}
depends on the null hypothesis tested:
if the null hypothesis is {it:H0:beta=b0},
it suggests the parameter {it:beta} is poorly identified or unidentified;
if the null hypothesis is {it:H0:E(Zu)=0},
it suggests the exogeneity conditions are generally satisfied.

{title:Summary interpretations of {it:weakiv10} output: 2 endogenous regressors}

{pstd}
The following summarizes what the various statistics assume and test
in the two-endogenous-regressors case, and how to interpret the results.
The structural parameters, {it:beta1} and {it:beta2},
are the coefficients on the endogenous regressors;
{it:b1} and {it:b2} are hypothesized values for {it:beta1} and {it:beta2}, respectively.
Roughly speaking,
a well-specified model is one in which
{it:H0:beta1=b1 and beta2=b2} cannot be rejected
for a narrow range of hypothesized values {it:b1} and {it:b2}
(i.e., {it:beta1} and {it:beta2} are precisely estimated}
and the assumption of instrument exogeneity
cannot be rejected for a wide range of hypothesized values {it:b1} and {it:b2}
(i.e., the exogeneity assumption is generally satisified).

{pstd}
An 2-dimensional confidence set is a straightforward extension
of a 1-dimensional confidence interval.
An {it:L%} confidence set is
the range of {it:b1} and {it:b2} such that
the rejection probability (=1-{it:pvalue}) is below {it:L%}.
{opt weakiv10} uses graphical methods to report confidence sets and rejection probabilities;
these are specified using the {it:graph(.)} option.
A confidence set is graphed in x-y space as a contour plot
using Stata 12's {helpb graph twoway contour}.
Up to 3 confidence levels can be specified using the {it:levels(.)} option;
these will be plotted as lower/higher contours in the contour plot.
The rejection probability is graphed in x-y-z space using Mander's (2005) {helpb surface};
the contours plotted by {helpb contour} are the contours of this surface.
The confidence sets plotted by {opt weakiv10} can, in overdidentified models,
be empty, disjoint (composed of unconnected regions), open-ended, etc.
An empty confidence set (null set) means
there is no possible combination of values {it:b1} and {it:b2}
that is consistent with the model;
this is an indication of misspecification when {it:L%} is fairly high.
Disjoint confidence regions arise when the rejection probability surface
dips below {it:L%} in more than one range.
Open-ended confidence regions commonly arise when the grid
does not extend far enough to capture the point where the rejection probability
crosses above the {it:L%} plane.


{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{marker model_options}{...}
{dlgtab:Model options (when used for standalone estimation)}

{phang} {it:iv_cmd} specifies the IV estimator to use:
{helpb ivregress}, {helpb ivreg2}, {helpb ivreg2h},
{helpb xtivreg}, {helpb xtivreg2}, {helpb ivprobit} or {helpb ivtobit}.
This option is valid only when {opt weakiv10}
is used for standalone estimation and the details of the model
are also provided; see {help weakiv10##syntax:Syntax} above.

{marker test_options}{...}
{dlgtab:Testing}

{phang} {opt null(#)} specifies the null hypothesis for the coefficient on the
endogenous variable in the IV model. The default is
{cmd:null(0)}.
The {opt null1(#)} and {opt null2(#)} options can be used
to specify the null for the 2-endog-regressor case;
the default null is 0 for both coefficients.

{phang} {opt kwt(#)} is the weight put on the {it:K} test statistic in the {it:K-J} test.
The default is {opt kwt(0.8)}.
It may not be used with the {opt kjlevel(#k #j)} option; see below.

{phang} {opt lm} specifies that LM tests instead of
the default Wald/Minimum Distance tests are reported (linear models only).

{phang} {opt strong(varname)} specifies that,
in a 2-endogenous-regressor estimation,
the endogenous regressor {it:varname} is strongly identified (linear models only).
Tests and graphs are reported for the weakly-identified regressor only.

{phang} {opt small} specifies that small-sample adjustments be made when test
statistics are calculated for linear IV estimation.
When used in standalone estimation by {opt weakiv10},
the default is not to employ small-sample adjustments.
When used after estimation by {helpb ivregress}, {helpb ivreg2} or {helpb ivreg2h},
the default is given by whatever small-sample
adjustment option was chosen in the IV command.
Small-sample adjustments are always made for IV probit and IV tobit estimation.
The default small-sample adjustment is N/(N-L)
where L is the number of exogenous variables (regressors and instruments);
for the fixed effects estimator, L includes the number of fixed effects;
if a cluster-robust VCE is used, the small-sample adjustment is
N_clust/(N_clust-1)*(N-1)/(N-L),
where N_clust is the number of clusters.


{marker ci_options}{...}
{dlgtab:Confidence interval estimation}

{phang} {opt noci} requests that confidence intervals not be estimated/reported.
Grid-based test inversion can be time-intensive,
so this option can save time if a grid search is not required,
either because confidence intervals are not needed
or because a closed-form solution for confidence intervals is available
(the linear model with homoskedastic errors only).

{phang} {opt points(#)} specifies the number of equally spaced values over
which to calculate the confidence sets.
In the single endogenous regressor case,
the default is {cmd:points(100)} and the maximum number of points is {cmd:points(800)}.
In the 2-endog regressor case,
the defaults are {cmd:points1(10)} and {cmd:points2(10)},
and can either be set separately or set simultaneously by {cmd:points(#)};
the total number of values in the grid over which the search takes place
will be {cmd:points1(#)}*{cmd:points2(#)}.
Increasing the number of grid points will increase the time required to
estimate the confidence intervals, but a greater number of grid points will
improve precision.

{pmore} {bf:Note:} The default grid is centered around the point estimate
with a width equal to twice the Wald confidence interval.
With weak instruments,
this is often too small of a grid to estimate the confidence intervals and sets.

{phang} {opt gridmult(#)} is a way of specifying a grid to calculate confidence sets.
This option specifies that the grid be {it:#} times the size
of the Wald confidence interval. The default is {cmd:gridmult(2)}.

{phang} {opt gridlimits(numlist)} is another way of specifying
the grid to calculate the confidence sets.
The user provides the lower and upper limits in {it:numlist}.
This option is not compatible with {opt gridmult(#)}
and will override it if it is also specified.
For the 2-endogenous regressor case,
the limits are specified separately for the two regressors using
the {opt gridlimits1(numlist)} and {opt gridlimits2(numlist)} options.

{phang} {opt grid(numlist)} allows the user to list explicitly
the numeric values of the grid points over which to calculate the confidence sets.
This option is not compatible with any other grid options
and will override them if they are also specified.

{phang} {opt usegrid} forces grid-based test inversion for confidence-interval
estimation under the homoskedastic linear IV model. The default is to use the
analytic solution. Under the other models, grid-based estimation is the only
method.

{phang} {opt level(#)} specifies the default confidence level,
as a percentage, for confidence intervals.
The default is {cmd:level(95)} or as set by {cmd:set level}.
Changing {opt level(#)} also changes the level of significance
used to determine this result: [100-{opt level(#)}]%.
Up to 3 levels can be provided as {opt level(numlist)};
this option is useful for graphing,
when multiple confidence intervals or confidence sets
corresponding to different confidence levels
can be represented in the same graph.
If more than one level is provided, the first is used for tests.
The option can also be used to tweak graphs when {opt weakiv10}'s replay syntax is used.

{phang} {opt arlevel(#)} optionally specifies the confidence level, as a percentage,
for the {it:AR} confidence interval if different from the default confidence level.

{phang} {opt jlevel(#)} optionally specifies the confidence level, as a percentage,
for the {it:J} confidence interval if different from the default confidence level.

{phang} {opt kjlevel(#)} (usage 1) optionally specifies the overall confidence level, as a percentage,
for the {it:K-J} confidence interval if different from the default confidence level.

{phang} {opt kjlevel(#k #j)} (usage 2) optionally specifies the separate confidence levels,
as percentages, for the {it:K} and {it:J} tests in the construction of
the {it:K-J} test and confidence intervals.
The overall test level will be (1-(1-{it:#k}/100)*(1-{it:#j}/100)).
Note that this implicitly specifies the weight on the {it:K} and {it:J} tests
and may not be used with the {opt kwt(#)} option.


{marker graph_options}{...}
{dlgtab:Graphing}

{phang} {opt graph(string)} specifies the test rejection probabilities
to plot vs. the hypothesized value for the structural parameter.
Options available are {it:ar}, {it:k}, {it:j}, {it:clr} (1-endog-regressor case only),
{it:kj}, {it:wald} and {it:all}.
Fo exactly-identified models only {it:ar} and {it:wald} are available.
They may be specified in lower or upper case.
For the 1-endogenous-regressor case,
colors for the different rejection probabilities are preassigned
and do not change with the order or list of tests specified.
Default colors can be overridden with the {opt graphopt(string)} option.

{phang} {opt graphxrange(numlist)} allows the user to specify
the range of the x-axis in graph of rejection probabilities.
It is equivalent to adding "{it:if x>=ll & x<=ul}" in a Stata graph command,
where {it:ll} and {it:ul} are the lower and upper limits for the x-axis, respectively.
(NB: This option is not available for the 2-endogenous-regressor case.)
This option does {it:not} affect the limits of the grid search;
to specify these, use the {opt gridlimits(numlist)} option.

{phang} {opt graphopt(string)} allows the user to specify additional graphing options,
such as titles, subtitle, colors, etc.
For the 1-endogenous-regressor case the internal graph command is {helpb scatter},
and {opt weakiv10} will pass the full contents of {opt graphopt(string)} to it.
For the 2-endogenous-regressor case the internal graph command is {helpb graph combine}
(to combine the contour and surface plots),
and {opt weakiv10} will pass the full contents of {opt graphopt(string)} to it.

{phang} {opt contouropt(string)} allows the user to specify additional graphing options
to the internal call to Stata's {helpb graph contour} or {helpb graph contourline} commands.
The default is to produce contour line graphs using {helpb graph contourline};
to request shaded contour graphs using {helpb graph contour},
specify {opt contouropt(contourshade ...)}.

{phang} {opt surfaceopt(string)} allows the user to specify additional graphing options
to the internal call to Mander's (2005) {helpb surface} command.

{phang} {opt contouronly} (2-endogenous-regressor case only)
specifies that only the contour plot (confidence set) is graphed;
the surface plot is not provided.

{phang} {opt surfaceonly} (2-endogenous-regressor case only)
specifies that only the surface plot (surface of rejection probabilities) is graphed;
the contour plot is not provided.

{marker misc_options}{...}
{dlgtab:Miscellaneous options}

{phang} {opt estadd}[({it:prefix})] causes {opt weakiv10) to mimic the behavior of {helpb estadd} (Jann 2009).
When it is omitted, {opt weakiv10} works like most {opt eclass} commands in Stata
and leaves behind in memory the full set of {opt weakiv10} saved results and nothing else.
When {opt estadd} is specified,
{opt weakiv10} leaves behind in memory the results of command used to estimate the IV model
({helpb ivregress}, {helpb ivreg2}, {helpb ivreg2h}, {helpb ivprobit} or {helpb ivtobit})
but with {opt weakiv10} results added to the estimation results (macros and scalars).
{it:prefix} is optional; when included,
the added results have the same names as used by {opt weakiv10}
but with {it:prefix} added.

{phang} {cmdab:eststore:wald(name)}}
stores the IV model estimated by
{helpb ivregress}, {helpb ivreg2}, {helpb ivreg2h}, {helpb ivprobit} or {helpb ivtobit}
under {it:name}.

{phang} {cmdab:estuse:wald(name)}}
obtains the IV model from a stored previous estimation by
{helpb ivregress}, {helpb ivreg2}, {helpb ivreg2h}, {helpb ivprobit} or {helpb ivtobit}.

{phang} {cmdab:display:wald}
displays the model estimated by IV for Wald tests prior to reporting {opt weakiv10} results.

{opt weakiv10} builds on and extends the command {helpb rivest} by Finlay and Magnusson (2009).
The main differences and extensions are:
(a) extension to the 2-endogenous-regressor case;
(b) graphics options that allow the plotting of confidence intervals and rejection probabilities (1-endog-regressor),
and confidence regions and rejection surfaces (2-endog-regressors);
(c) support for a wider range of variance-covariance estimators in linear IV estimation;
including HAC (heteroskedastic-and autocorrelation-robust) and two-way clustering VCEs;
(d) support for LM versions of the tests;
(e) specification of models directly in the command line as well as obtaining specification from
a previously-estimated or stored model ({opt weakiv10} is an {it:eclass} command);
(f) minor changes in terminology and syntax.

{pstd}
The code in {opt weakiv10} for the closed-form solutions for confidence intervals
in the i.i.d. case (homosekdasticity and independence)
derives from {helpb condivreg} by Mikusheva and Poi.
