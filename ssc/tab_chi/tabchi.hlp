Two-way tables of frequencies with chi-square and residuals
-----------------------------------------------------------

Description
-----------

^tabchi^ displays information derived from the r x c table for rowvar
and colvar. 

The display contains 

   row and column identifiers, 
   
   (by default) observed frequencies and expected frequencies on a null
   hypothesis of no association between the row and column variables, 
   
   and (if desired)

        raw residuals, observed - expected, 
    
        Pearson residuals, (observed - expected) / sqrt(expected),
    
        contributions to chi-square, (observed - expected)^^2 / expected
    
   and  adjusted residuals, Pearson residuals divided by an estimate of their 
        standard error.

The Pearson and likelihood-ratio chi-square statistics and their
P-values are also given.

^tabchii^ displays the same information derived from the r x c table
using the values specified; rows are separated by the backslash ^\^.


Options
-------

^replace^ indicates that the variables listed by the ^tabchii^ command
    are to be left as the current data in place of whatever data were
    there.

^raw^, ^pearson^, ^cont^ and ^adjust^ produce displays of raw residuals,
    Pearson residuals, contributions to chi-square and adjusted
    residuals respectively.

^noo^, ^noe^ suppress display of observed and expected frequencies.
    These options may be useful when the focus is on residuals. ^noo^
    and ^noe^ without at least one of ^raw^, ^pearson^, ^cont^ and ^adjust^
    suppress the tabular display.

tabdisp_options are options of ^tabdisp^ other than ^cellvar( )^, which
    may be used to tune the tabular display.

Saved results

^tabchi^ and ^tabchii^ leave behind appropriate rclass results produced by 
^tabulate^.
