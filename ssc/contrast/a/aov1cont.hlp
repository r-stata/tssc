..-help for ^aov1cont^                                     (statalist Mar. 20, 1998)..-Contrasts in one-way ANOVA from means, SD's and N's---------------------------------------------------    ^aov1cont^ nvar meanvar sdvar [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]^,^	^c^oeffs^(^coeffvar^)^|^tr^end [ ^le^vel^(^#^)^ ]Description-----------^aov1cont^ calculates the contrast (L) for coefficients in coeffvar over themeans in meanvar.  The group sizes are in nvar and the SDs are in sdvar.Options-------^coeffs(^coeffvar^)^|^trend^: one of these is REQUIRED. If ^trend^ is specified,L is a standardized linear trend contrast using integers with spacing 1.^level(^#^)^ defines the confidence interval coverage for L. Default: $S_level.Remarks-------Like @contrast@, ^aov1cont^ calculates the standardized contrast L as	L = (a1 * mean1) + (a2 * mean2) + (a3 * mean3) + ...where mean1 is the first value of meanvar and a1 is the first STANDARDIZEDcoefficient in coeffvar, and so on.  ^aov1cont^ always standardizes the coeff-icients so that they add up to zero; it does so by subtracting the mean ofcoeffvar from each of its values.  The standardized coefficients (a1, a2, etc)are labelled ^__a^ in the output from ^aov1cont^.  The output includes aconfidence interval for L and a significance test for L = 0.Examples-------- . ^aov1cont n mean sd, coeffs(c)^ . ^aov1cont n mean sd, trend^Stored------	^$S_1^	total number of observations in analysis of variance	^$S_2^	number of groups in analysis of variance	^$S_3^	value of standardized contrast, L	^$S_4^	standard error of L	^$S_5^	lower confidence limit for L	^$S_6^	upper confidence limit for L	^$S_7^	t value for test of L = 0	^$S_8^	P value for test of L = 0Also see-------- Manual:  [R] onewayOn-line:  help for @oneway@, @contrast@.
