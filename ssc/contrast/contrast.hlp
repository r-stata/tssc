The command has two forms.^contrasi^ is an "immediate" contrasts command; see [U] 25 Immediate commands. See Remarks for a detailed description.Options-------^level(^#^)^ defines the confidence interval coverage. Default: $S_level.^trend^ makes the contrast coefficients equally spaced with spacing 1 (i.e.    1, 2, 3, ...,  also known, confusingly, as a linear contrast) and then    standardizes them.  See Remarks for further details.^adjust^ first calculates fitted values according to the full ANOVA model, then    calculates means of these fitted values over the levels of fac1.anova_options are any of Stata's standard @anova@ options.Remarks-------Note that the first form of ^contrast^ permits arbitrarily complex analysisof variance or analysis of covariance models, whereas the second form and^contrasi^ only support one-way analysis of variance models.In all cases the contrast coefficients are `standardized' inside the programby subtraction of their mean, so as to add up to zero.  These standardizedcoefficients are displayed as ^__a^ in the output.A factor level or group may be omitted from a contrast (but NOT from theanalysis of variance) by specifying the corresponding coefficient as missing(^.^).  Note that a zero coefficient omits the corresponding level or groupONLY if all the coefficients you supply add up to zero, as otherwise thestandardization changes the zero to a non-zero value of ^__a^ internally.The output includes a confidence interval for L, a significance test for thehypothesis L = 0, an overall analysis of variance F-test that the group (orfac1) means are equal and the residual standard deviation from the analysisof variance.First form----------The first form of ^contrast^ calculates the standardized contrast, L, for coeff-icients in coefflist over the means of yvar defined by the levels (uniquevalues) of fac1.  That is, ^contrast^ calculates	L = (a1 * mean1) + (a2 * mean2) + (a3 * mean3) + ...where mean1 is the mean of yvar at the lowest level of fac1 and a1 is thecorresponding standardized coefficient in coeffvar, and so on.If term2, term3, ... are given, the residual SD is calculated from an analysisof variance which includes fac1 and the other terms.  Terms can be factors orcontinuous predictors; the latter are specified by using the @anova@ option^continuous(^varlist^)^ (see help for @anova@).Second form-----------To use the second form of ^contrast^, you MUST specify the ^means^ option.  Thecontrast (L) is calculated directly from frequencies, means and SDs stored inthe variables nvar, meanvar and sdvar.  The coefficients may be determined byspecifying ^trend^, or entered directly in coefflist, or stored in a variable(coeffvar) whose rows contain the coefficients in the same order as the meansof meanvar.^contrasi^--------^contrasi^ carries out the same analysis as the second form of ^contrast^, butusing frequencies, means, SDs and coefficients that you enter directly in n1,mean1, sd1, coeff1, etc.  Omitting the coefficients (coeff1, coeff2, etc) isequivalent to specifying ^trend^.Examples-------- . ^contrast price rep78, coeffs(1 2 3 4 5)^ . ^contrast price rep78 foreign, coeffs(1 1 2 2 .)^ . ^contrast price rep78 foreign mpg, coeffs(1 2 3 4 5) cont(mpg) adjust^ . ^contrast n ymean sd, means coeffs(c)^ . ^contrast n ymean sd, means coeffs(-1 1 2)^ . ^contrast n ymean sd, means trend level(90)^ . ^contrasi 25 12.2 4.3 -2 \ 44 17.3 6.2 1 \ 21 21.9 7.4 1^ . ^contrasi 25 12.2 4.3 \ 44 17.3 6.2 \ 21 21.9 7.4, trend^ . ^contrasi 25 12.2 4.3 \ 44 17.3 6.2 \ 21 21.9 7.4^	(same as previous)Stored------	^$S_1^	number of observations in analysis of variance	^$S_2^	number of groups in analysis of variance	^$S_3^	value of standardized contrast, L	^$S_4^	standard error of L	^$S_5^	lower confidence limit for L	^$S_6^	upper confidence limit for L	^$S_7^	t value for test of L = 0	^$S_8^	P value for test of L = 0Also see-------- Manual:  [R] anova, onewayOn-line:  help for @anova@, @oneway@
