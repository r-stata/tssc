Power is calculated if ^n()^ is specified as a positive number,otherwise total sample size is estimated. ^ssizebi^ computes sample size/power for the (global/trend) unconditionalchisquare test or the conditional test based on the hypergeometric distributionwith the one-step Peto approximation to the odds ratio (OR). Sample size/poweris calculated in the unconditional case under either local or distantalternatives. Under local alternatives (eg max(OR,1/OR)<=2), ^ssizebi^ uses thenull covariance matrix under both null and alternative hypotheses. Theunconditional test with local alternatives is the usual Pearson chisquare test.Local alternatives are assumed in the conditional case.Options-------^ng^roup^(^#^)^ is the number of comparative groups. The default is^ng^roup^(^K^)^, where K is number of specified proportions. If ^ng^group^( )^specifies a number m greater than K (the number of the given proportionsp1 p2 ... pK), the default value of each of the remaining m-K proportions is the mean of p1,p2, ... pK.^ar^atio^(^#1 #2 ... #K^)^ is the allocation ratio. The default is equal samplesizes.^al^pha^(^#^)^ specifies the significance level of the test; the default is     ^al^pha^(.05)^.^po^wer^(^#^)^ is power of the test.  Default is ^po^wer^(.80)^.^n(^#^)^ is the total sample size.  If specified and is positive, ^ssizebi^reports power.  If not specified or specified as ^n(^0^)^, sample size isreported.^co^ndit indicates a conditional test (fixed total number of events).no^lo^cal specifies non-local alternative. The default is ^lo^cal.^tr^end indicates a test for trend^do^ses^(^#1 #2 ... #K^)^ specifies doses in a dose-response (linear trend) test.The default, if ^tr^end is specified, is ^do^ses^(^1 2 ... K^)^Examples-------- 1. Comparing two proportions p1 and p2 unconditionally: . ^ssizebi^ .25 .35   or  . ^ssizebi^ .25 .35, noloc 2.
