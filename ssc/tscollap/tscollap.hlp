You must ^tsset^ your data before using ^tscollap^; see help @tsset@.If the data are a panel of timeseries (i.e. if a ^panelvar^ has been specifiedin ^tsset^) the specification of the panel identification variable will automatically be retained in the resulting dataset (it need not, and should not,be specified in the ^varlist^).  Time-series operators may not be used. Description-----------^tscollap^ converts the timeseries data in memory into a dataset of means, sums,or selected values taken from the specified interval. It is a variant of ^collapse^, which automatically forms the groups over which statistics are to be calculated from an understanding of the calendar data. For instance, monthly data may be converted to quarterly, half-yearly, or annual (yearly) data by specifying to(q), to(h), or to(y), respectively. Data may be averaged over the interval (using either an arithmetic or geometric mean), or summed (as would be appropriate for income statement data). Either the first or the last observation of each interval may be selected (so that, e.g., end-of-period values may be readily assembled). Since its syntax (and internal logic) is taken from ^collapse^, more than one statistic may be generated from a single variable (e.g. both average and end-of-period values may be specified by using different target_var names). ^tscollap^ embodies the June2000 correction to ^collapse^.All variables not specified in the target list are dropped (including the current tsset variable), and a new tsset variable is generated as freq_freq (as long as that variable does not already exist). The ^gen^erate option may be used to customize the new tsset variable. If a ^panelid^ variable is inuse by ^tsset^, it should not be listed; it will be automatically retained.Options-------^to(^freq^)^ specifies the target frequency, which must be specified. It maytake on any value lower than the current value as understood by tsset. ^freq^must be given as ^q^, ^h^, ^y^, in either lower- or upper-case. ^gen^erate(^freqvar^) may be used to specify the name of the new ^tsset^ variable, which will be formatted at the target frequency.Examples-------- . ^tscollap rs r20, to(q)^ . ^tscollap rs (first) rsf=rs (last) rsl=rs, to(q)^ . ^tscollap dgnp (gmean) gnpdot=dgnp, to(y) gen(year)^Note----^tscollap^ makes use of ^_gfilter^, part of Nicholas J. Cox' package ^egenmore^.My thanks (without implicating) Nick Cox for guidance in improving ^tscollap^.Author------        Christopher F Baum, Boston College, USA        baum@@bc.edu                Also see--------  Manual:  ^[R] collapse^ On-line:  help for @collapse@, @egenmore@
