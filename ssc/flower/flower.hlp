Each sunflower is composed of a central dot and a numberof "petals" (straight line segments) emanating from the central dot.Remarks-------By default, the sunflower plot shows the number of points with exactlyidentical x and y values. Even in a relatively small data set there may beseveral ties, especially if values are integers or on some other coarsescale.Otherwise, binning on either the y axis or the x axis or both may defineintervals. Points within the interval are counted and plotted at thecenter of the interval.It is possible to combine binning on one axis and the use of exact valueson the other axis, and this may be best for a combination of a measuredvariable and a categorical variable.A dot represents a count of 1, two petals a count of 2, three petals acount of 3, and so forth.Frequency weights may be specified.The user may modify the width or number of bins, the size of a sunflower,and the maximum number of petals to be drawn.Options-------^yround(^#^)^ or ^ybins(^#^)^ specifies binning on the y axis, by eitheran argument for ^round(^yvar^,^yround^)^ or a number of bins, which isconverted into an argument for ^round( )^ by dividing the observed rangeon yvar (maximum - minimum) by that number. Only one may be chosen.^xround(^#^)^ or ^xbins(^#^)^ specifies binning on the x axis, by eitheran argument for ^round(^xvar^,^xround^)^ or a number of bins, which isconverted into an argument for ^round( )^ by dividing the observed rangeon xvar (maximum - minimum) by that number. Only one may be chosen.The arguments for ^yround( )^ and ^xround( )^ should be expressed in theunits of the respective variables.Example: the observed range of ^mpg^ in the auto data set is 29, from 12to 41, miles per gallon. If ^mpg^ is to be shown on the y axis, specifying^yround(5)^ puts values in bins with centers 10 (5) 40, multiples of 5,while specifying ^ybins(10)^ puts values in bins of width 29 / 10 = 2.9,with centers 11.6 (= 4 * 2.9) to 40.6 (= 14 * 2.9). Note that in this andin other cases the bin centers may lie outside the observed range.^psize(^size^)^ specifies the size of the sunflower symbols relative tothe default size (100). For example, ^psize(50)^ will draw half-sizesymbols and ^psize(200)^ will draw double-size symbols. Sunflowers are notdrawn for non-positive values of size.^petals(^maxnum^)^ specifies the maximum number of petals that willdisplay. Points with maxnum or more points in the neighborhood all displaywith the same symbol. Petals do not display for values of maxnum < 2. Thedefault value of maxnum is 10.graph_options are those allowed with ^graph, twoway^. The defaultgraph_options are ^connect(.)^ and ^pen(2)^, along with default titles andlabels. ^symbol()^ is preset and cannot be changed.Examples-------- . ^flower mpg displ^ . ^flower mpg weight, yb(20) xb(20)^Authors-------  Thomas J.
