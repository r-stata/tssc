Frequencies andconfidence intervals can be included as an option. The interquartilerange is reported when medians are selected.The command produces a menu in which to specify{cmd: The response variable}	          often known as the outcome variable{cmd: The type of response}	          metric/binary/failure/count{cmd: The follow-up time}	          if appropriate{cmd: The first explanatory variable}     determining the rows of the table{cmd: The second explanatory variable}    determining the columns, if required.When a varlist is specified, only those variables in the varlist areincluded in the menus.As default, explanatory variables with more than 10 values are not allowed when making tables, but this can be changed in the menu. Selecting {cmd: tables} produces a sub-menu in which to specify the nature of the summary required according to the response: {cmd:metric}		means/geometric means/medians{cmd:binary}		proportions/odds{cmd:failure}		rates{cmd:count}		ratesThis sub-menu gives the opportunity to change the units forproportions  and for rates to per #. It also givesthe opportunity to choose to display frequencies, to display confidenceintervals, to change level of confidence, and to reverse the rows andcolumns of the table.When the {cmd:display} option is used the program displays {cmd:tabmenu2}, acommand-line version of {cmd:tabmenu1}, which can be pasted into thecommand window, or a do file, and which will produce the same table asthe one just produced by {cmd:tabmenu1}. {title:Options}{cmd:clear}	Clears variable names from the menu.{cmd:display}	Produces {cmd:tabmenu2}, the command line version of {cmd:tabmenu1}. {title:Also see}Online help for: {help tabmenu2}, {help effmenu1}, {help effmenu2}.
