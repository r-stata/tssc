When a varlist is specified, onlythose variables in the varlist are included in the menus. The command produces a menu in which to specify{cmd:The response variable}			often known as the outcome {cmd:The type of response}			binary/metric/failure/count{cmd:The follow-up time}			for survival data{cmd:The matched set variable}			for matched case-control studies{cmd:The exposure variable}			i.e. the main explanatory variable{cmd:The modifying explanatory variable}	if required{cmd:Whether study is matched case-control}     for matched case-control studies{cmd:Matched set indentifier}			for matched case-control studies{cmd:Baseline}					baseline level for a categorical exposureWhen either the exposure or modifier is categorical, a maximum of 15 values is allowed.Selecting Effects produces a sub-menu in which to specify how theeffects are to be measured according to the response:{cmd:metric}		differences of means/ratios of means{cmd:binary}		ratios or differences of proportions/odds ratios{cmd:failure}		rate ratios/rate differences{cmd:count}		rate ratios/rate differences{cmd:WARNING}: when selecting ratios of proportions, differences in proportions, orrate differences, there may be problems in convergence with some data sets.This sub-menu gives the opportunity to change the units of the effectto per # when the exposure variable is metric. The sub-menu  alsoallows the inclusion of control variables, which can be categorical ormetric. If they are metric they must be selected in the both the controlvariables box and in the control variables which are metric box. {title:Options}{cmd:clear}		Clears previous selections from the menu.{cmd:display}		Produces {cmd:effmenu2}, the command line version of {cmd:effmenu1}. {title:Also see}Help for {help effmenu2}, {help tabmenu1}, {help tabmenu2}.
