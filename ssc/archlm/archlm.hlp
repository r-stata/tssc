You must ^tsset^ your data before using ^archlm^; see help @tsset@.Description-----------^archtest^ computes a Lagrange multiplier test for autoregressive conditionalheteroskedasticity (ARCH) effects in a regression residual series for a specified number of lags p, as proposed by Engle (1982). A list of lag ordersmay be given; if none are given, one lag is presumed. For each specified order,the squared residual series is regressed on p of its own lags. The test statistic, a T R^^2 measure, is distributed Chi-squared(p) under the null hypothesis of no ARCH effects.The command displays the test statistic, degrees of freedom and P-value for each specified lag order and places values in the return array. Type^return list^ to see such values. Examples--------	. ^regress csales isales^	. ^archlm^	. ^archlm^, lags(4 8 12)^References----------Engle, Robert, "Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity with Estimates of    the Variance of United Kingdom Inflation", Econometrica, 50, 1982, 987-1007Authors-------        Christopher F Baum, Boston College, USA        baum@@bc.edu        Vince Wiggins, Stata Corporation        vwiggins@@stata.com        Also see-------- Manual:  ^[R] regress^, ^[R] regression diagnostics^On-line:  help for @regdiag@, @regress@, @time@, @tsset@; @arch@
