Graph CUSUM and CUSUM squared-----------------------------	^cusum6^ varlist [^, noc^onstant ^d^ate(varname) ^nop^lot  other-options]Description-----------^cusum6^ calculates and graphs the cumulative sums (CUSUM) of the recursiveresiduals and their squares from the regression specified by "varlist".  Eachgraph includes a 95 percent confidence band.^cusum6^ is for use with time series data.Options-------^noc^onstant eliminates the constant from the regressions.^nop^lot suppresses the graphs.Other options-------------The CUSUM statistics and the confidence bands can be stored for later use.The options for storing these variables are    CUSUM information    -----------------    ^rr^(varname) stores the recursive residuals.        ^c^s(varname) stores the CUSUM.    ^l^w(varname) stores the lower limit of the confidence band.    ^u^w(varname) stores the upper limit of the confidence bankd.    CUSUM of squares information    ----------------------------    ^c^s2(varname) stores the CUSUM of squares.    ^lww^(varname) stores the lower limit of the confidence band.    ^s^qline(varname) stores the reference line.    ^uww^(varname) stores the upper limit of the confidence band.Examples--------     . cusum6 m1 L.m1 L2.m1     . cusum6 m1 L.m1 L2.m1, cs(cusum) cs2(cusum2) noplot     . cusum6 m1 L(1/4).m1     References----------Brown, R.L., J.
