.-help for ^wbull^.-Fitting Weibull distribution by maximum likelihood--------------------------------------------------    ^wbull^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [weight] [, ^l^og ]Description-----------^wbull^ fits a Weibull distribution to a single variable by the methodof maximum likelihood. Frequency weights may be used to fit variablesgiven in frequency distribution form.The distribution is here parameterised by a scale parameter b and ashape parameter c, so that the probability density function is                           c - 1               c    f(x) = (c / b)  (x / b)       exp(- (x / b) )for x >= 0, b > 0 and c > 0.The estimation is carried out by ^weibull^.  Its _b[_cons] is ln b, andits [ln_p][_cons] is ln c.Option------^log^ specifies that the results of ^weibull^ should be displayed.Example-------        . ^wbull x^Saved values------------    S_1      number of values used    S_2      ML estimate of b    S_3      ML estimate of cReferences----------Evans, M., Hastings, N. and Peacock, B. 1993.
