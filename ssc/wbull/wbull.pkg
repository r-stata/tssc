d 'WBULL': module to fit Weibull distribution by maximum likelihood
d
d wbull fits a Weibull distribution to a single variable by the
d method of maximum likelihood. Frequency weights may be used to
d fit variables given in frequency distribution form. The
d distribution is here  parameterised by a scale parameter b and a
d shape parameter c.
