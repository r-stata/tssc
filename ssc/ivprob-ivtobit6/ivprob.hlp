.-help for ^ivprob^, ^divprob^, and ^ivtobit^                    .-Instrumental variables probit and tobit using Amemiya Generalized Least Squares-------------------------------------------------------------------------------        ^ivprob^, ^divprob^, ^ivtobit^   ^ivprob^ and ^ivtobit^ are used for estimating probit models where one or more of the independent variables is endogenous.  Neither weights nor the @robust@option are implemented.^divprob^ produces marginal effects for ^ivprob^. Description-----------These programs implement Amemiya Generalized Least Squares (AGLS) estimators for probitand tobit with endogenous regressors.  Newey (1987, eq. 5.6) provides the formulas used.  The endogenous regressors are treated as linear functions of the instrumentsand the other exogenous variables.  For a good summary of how AGLS works, see Maddala (1983) pp. 247-252.Syntax------^ivprob^ depvar  [^if^ exp] [^in^ range], endog(varlist1) iv(varlist2) exog(varlist3)^divprob^ depvar  [^if^ exp] [^in^ range], endog(varlist1) iv(varlist2) exog(varlist3) [CLAssic]^ivtobit^ depvar  [^if^ exp] [^in^ range], endog(varlist1) iv(varlist2) exog(varlist3)	[ll(#) ul(#)]where:   depvar is the dependent variable,   varlist1 are the endogenous variables,   varlist2 are the instruments for varlist1,   varlist3 are the other exogenous variables, and   ll and ul are the censoring points for the tobit (see @tobit@) with defaults of      zero (for ll) and 9999999 (for ul).   For a description of the ^classic^ option with ^divprob^, see @dprobit@.References----------Maddala, G.
