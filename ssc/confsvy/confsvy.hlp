.-help for ^confsvy^ .-Assessing confounding effects in survey studies ----------------------------------------------------------------    ^confsvy^ yvar xvar,  [^con^(covlist) ^cat^(covlist) ^nog^raph 		^b^ackward ^det^ail ^l^evel(#) ^co^ef graph_options]        ^confsvy^ calculates the change in effect estimates such as odds ratio, after adjusting for a potential confounder using either "forward selection" or "backward deletion" strategies. ^confsvy^ also calculates and graphs adjusted effect measures and their confidence intervals. The order of variables being selected is based on the "importance" (magnitude) of "change in estimate".   Variables required-------------------    ^yvar^ -- dependent variable, binary variable for logistic or poisson         regression; survival time variable for Cox proportional hazards        model.      ^xvar^ -- exposure of interest         Options --------    ^con^ -- list of potential continuous confounding variables.     ^cat^ -- list of potential categorical confouding variables.     ^nog^graph -- suppresses graphs. By default, a graph is given.       ^b^ackward -- specifies selection strategy as "back deletion method",         otherwise, "forward selection" method is default.    ^co^ef -- graphs regression coefficients instead of effect estimates         for graphs.    ^det^ail -- gives details at each step. Default only gives a summary.     ^l^evel(#) -- specifies the confidence level, in percent, for 	    calculation of confidence intervals (default=95%)          ^graph_options^ -- some options with ^graph^ are allowed; see help         @graph@.Examples--------- .  ^confsvy dead ab_uria, con(sbp weight) cat(sex agegroup)^        Calculates and graphs crude and adjusted odds ratios using        ^svylogit^ with a forward selection approach.          .  ^confsvy dead ab_uria, con(weight sbp) cat(sex agegroup) detail^        Calculates and graphs crude and adjusted odds ratios using         ^svylogit^.
