Exponential form and C.I. level are allowed as options without reestimation.Use: A 0-truncated Poisson model is appropriate when modeling count data     which does not have values of 0. This is to be distinguished from     data sets without 0 values, but which may have 0's. For example,     length of hospital stay data (LOS) begins with patients having a     LOS of 1. 0 values are not allowed. This is a situation where a     truncated model is appropriate.     Examples- -------- . ^trpois0 studytim died drug2 drug3, irr nolog^  . ^trpois0 infected cases cd4 cd8, nolog irr off(cases) cluster(prov)^ . ^trpois0, level(90)^    [redisplay]Also see- --------Manual:  [5s] poisson, glm, cnregOn-line:  help for @poisson@, @glm@, @cnreg@..-Joseph HilbeArizona State Universityatjmh@@asuvm.inre.asu.edu jhilbe@@aol.com
