{title:Description}

{pstd}
Statax includes 2 engines for highlighting Stata code in HTML and LaTeX documents.

{pstd}
Based on {browse "http://shjs.sourceforge.net/doc/gplv3.html":SHJS} engine, 
a new JavaScript was written to highlight Stata syntax. In addition, a new JQuery 
program was written to highlight {help global} {help macro} syntax. The JavaScript 
file developed SHJS is called {it:sh_main.js} and the file developed by the 
author for Stata is named {it:stata.js}. The author also developed a CSS style 
sheet to create a syntax highlighter identical to Stata do-file editor, which is 
included in {it:Stata.css} file. The JavaScript engine 
can be used in HTML files, online forums, or any website or blog for highlighting
Stata syntax. The program acurately highlights Stata commands, {help functions}, string, 
local and global {help macros}, digits, comments, and braces. The engine can also 
highlight the operator signs, but since Stata does not highlight operators, the 
default CSS shows them in black color. 


{pstd}
The LaTeX syntax highlighter was developed based on the 
{browse "https://www.ctan.org/pkg/listings?lang=en":listings} package which is used for typesetting 
source code in the document. In order to highlight Stata syntax in LaTeX document, you should 
{browse "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/Statax/master/Statax.tex":append the content of Statax.tex} 
to the heading of your LaTeX document. Alternatively, you can {bf:\include{c -(}path/to/statax.tex{c )-}} the 
{browse "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/Statax/master/Statax.tex":Statax.tex} file in the heading of 
your LaTeX document. Next, you can highlight Stata syntax by placing Stata commands between 
{bf:\begin{c -(}statax{c )-}} and {bf:\end{c -(}statax{c )-}}

{marker example}{...}
{title:Example of interactive use}

{pstd}
You would like to get a taste of the Statax syntax highlighter? run an exanple 
by specifying a name HTML filename 

{phang2}{cmd:. statax using example.html, replace}{p_end}

{pstd}
You have a do-file and you would like to convert it to HTML and highlight the 
syntax. It will create an HTML file with the same name as the do-file

{phang2}{cmd:. statax convert using} {help filename}.do, {opt replace}‚
