In its small-sample form, the test statistic uses transformed skewnessand kurtosis measures to generate empirical moments that are much closer tostandard normal. The test may be readily applied to a set of variables, suchas the residuals from a multivariate regression. Doornik and Hansen conductsimulations that illustrate that this test will generally have better size andpower than several proposed in the literature, including the multivariateShapiro-Wilk of Royston (1983). They find that their omnibus test "is both simple, has coorect size and good power properties." (p.6)Under the null hypothesis of normality of the specified k variables, the test statistic is distributed Chi-squared with 2 k degrees offreedom. An asymptotic form of the test is also provided; it is essentiallya multivariate equivalent of the Bowman and Shenton (1975) test, which thoseauthors consider "unsuitable except in very large samples." (p.2)Users of Stata 9.0+ should use ^omninorm^.Examples--------	. ^use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/micro/iris,clear^		. ^omninorm7  set_sepl set_sepw set_petw ^			. ^omninorm7  set_sepl set_sepw set_petw  set_petl ver_sepl ver_sepw^Acknowledgements----------------The code for this routine draws heavily from Jurgen Doornik's implementationof normtest.ox in the Ox programming language.
