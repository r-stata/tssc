Graphical 'Check' of the proportional hazards assumption.---------------------------------------------------------^stcumh^ stratavar baseh [^in^ range] [^if^ exp],	[^strc^ode^(^x,y^)^] [^save(^outsheet^)^] [^noc^urtail] [^k^eep^(^n^)^]	[graph_options]Description-----------Before ^stcumh^ can be effectuated, the dataset must be1)	@^stset^@, and2)	a stratified Cox regression analysis must have been performed;	where	2a) ^stratavar^	was the (nominal or ordinal) stratifying variable	(by specifying the ^st^rata(stratavar)-option of the @^stcox^@ command),	and where	2b)	^baseh^	was the newvar specified to hold the thereby saved baseline hazards	(by use of the ^baseh^azard^(^newvar^)^-option of the @^stcox^@	command).^stcumh^ plots estimates of the cumulative baseline hazards for two stratain ^stratavar^ against each other. The slope of the plotted graph will (atany time point) approximately be the relative risk between the two strata.If the proportional hazards assumption between the two strata (in theequivalent unstratified Cox regression analysis) is fulfilled, the plotshould be a straight line through (0,0).The failure time range of the two strata plotted might not be the same, andin default of specifying the ^noc^urtail-option (see options below), onlythe common failure time range is plotted. Therefore, information of thefailure time range in each strata and the common range plotted is issued tothe 'Results'-window. Also, the plotted common failure time range isindicated on the plot (as the t2title)!Caution:Whereas ^stcox^'s ^st^rata()-option allows for a list of variables, ^stcumh^assumes that only one stratifying variable is specified at a time. This is alimitation which can not be circumvented.Options-------[^strc^ode^(^x,y^)^] is not optional if ^stratavar^ has more than twostrata!!If there is more than two strata in the stratifying variable (^stratavar^),the proportional hazards assumption between any two strata in ^stratavar^can be 'checked' by specifying the code (integer) for the two strata x and yto be plotted.[^save(^outsheet^)^] Saves the failure time variable (time), the cumulativehazards for stratum 'x' (cumh0) and the cumulative hazards for stratum 'y'(cumh1) in the the outsheet file specified. (See help ^@outsheet@^).This option is needed when the time corresponding to specific points of thegraph is of interest!! (typically when the proportional hazards assumptioncan be seen to be violated, and the when the plotted graph can be describedas a piece by piece linear function. In this case, the time for the knots ofthe lines can be used to specify a specific alternative model, whichincludes the stratifying variable as a time dependent variable. Thisalternative model should then be tested formally against the more restrictedmodel with the stratifying variable as a time independent variable (by useof the @^lrtest^@, see also @^stlexis^@, @stegen@)).To get the time for the corresponding to the knots, the outfile can beentered into (for example) Excel, where the plot can be repeated. Thecumulative hazard for the knots must then be determined visually, and thecorresponding time be found in the spreedsheet.Graph-options-------------[^noc^urtail] The cumulative hazards cumulates with time (the failure time^(ftimevar)^ specified in the ^stset^ command). The time range for the twostrata to be plotted might not be the same, resulting in straight verticalor horizontal (heading or tailing) lines! In default of specifying the^noc^urtail-option, only the common failure time range is plotted![^k^eep^(^n^)^] In default of ^noc^urtail, possible a lot of non-censoredobservations is dropped (due to non overlapping ranges of failure times). Ifthis is occurring only in the high end of the time range, a long tailingline results. To improve readability of the plot, this tailing line can bereduced in length by specifying the number of ^n^ observations to be kept.If the number of observations in the tail is higher than ^n^, only ^n^observations is plotted. The number of kept and dropped observations isissued in the 'Results'-window.To effectuate the ^k^eep^(^n^)^-option, the ^noc^urtile-option must bespecified.^@graph@_options^ are allowed. Default labelling is supplied whengraph_options are absent, but the x-axis may be relabelled using the ^b2^graphics option, the y-axis may be relabelled using the ^l1^ option, and thetop title may be relabelled using the ^t1^ option. The second top title(t2titel) is used to specify the plotted failure time range, and can not bechanged!Example-------1)	If only two strata in stratavar:^stset^ ftimevar^stcox^ varlist, st(stratavar) baseh(baseh)^stcumh stratavar baseh, save(myout)^2)	If six strata in stratavar, left and right censoring in Cox:^stset^ ftimevar status, t0(entry_timevar)^stcox^ varlist, st(stratavar) baseh(baseh)^stcumh strata baseh, strc(1,6) l1(Stratum-'6'-name) b2(Stratum-'1'-name)save(myout)^(^strc(1,6)^ checks the proportional hazards assumption between stratum 1and stratum 6).In both examples above, the time, and the cumulative hazards for the twostrata is saved in the ascii outfile 'myout.raw'. This file can be read byother programs, for example, Excel, where the hazards and the correspondingtime can be inspected (see save-options above).3)	If display of non overlapping ranges of failure times is wonted:^stcumh strata baseh, nocurtail keep(200)^keeps up to 200 non-censored observation after the common failure time ondisplay.Author------      Kim Lyngby Mikkelsen      MD, Ph.D.-student	  Institute of preventive Medicine      Denmark      kimmik@ipm.hosp.dk or kimmik@dadlnet.dkAlso see-------- Manual:  ^[R] st, stset, stcoxOn-line:  help for @stset@; @stcox@, @graph@, @outsheet@, @^lrtest^@STB:  STB-41, ssa10.1: 	@staalen@, @stlexis@, and others.STB:  STB-41, ssa11:	@stegen@, and others.
