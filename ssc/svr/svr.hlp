{title:Introduction to survey replication commands}

{p}The prefix {cmd:svr} stands for SurVey Replication, and refers to commands
that analyze complex survey data
using replication methods.  The available methods are balanced repeated
replication (BRR), and several versions of survey jackknife (JK1, JK2, and JKn).
These methods are an alternative to the Taylor series linearization
methods available in Stata's {help svy} commands.  See {help survwgt} for
details on replication methods.


{p}Basic {cmd:svr} commands:

{p 4 23}help {help survwgt}{space 7}Creates sets of replication weights
for {cmd:svr} analysis.  Also performs other transformations on survey
sampling weights, including post-stratification, raking, and non-response
adjustments.

{p 4 23}help {help svrset}{space 8}Set variables for replication-based
analysis of survey data{p_end}


{p}Estimation commands:

{p 4 23}help {help svrmodel}{space 8}Linear regression and other regression-type models{p_end}

{p 4 23}help {help svrmean}{space 7}Estimation of population and subpopulation means{p_end}
{p 4 23}help {help svrratio}{space 6}Estimation of population and subpopulation ratios{p_end}
{p 4 23}help {help svrtotal}{space 6}Estimation of population and subpopulation totals{p_end}

{p 4 23}help {help svrtab}{space 8}Two-way tables for survey data{p_end}

{p 4 23}help {help svrcorr}{space 7}Estimation of correlation coefficients{p_end}

{p 4 23}help {help svrest}{space 8}Calculation of replication-based (co)variances for
other commands


{p}Post-estimation commands:

{p 4 23}The {cmd:svr} commands have been written such that Stata's {cmd:svy} post-estimation
commands function:

{p 4 23}help {help svylc}{space 9}Estimate linear combinations of parameters
		(e.g., differences of means, regression coefficients)

{p 4 23}help {help svytest}{space 7}Hypotheses tests for survey data

{p 4 23}help {help svresttest}{space 4}Hypotheses tests involving the statistics calculated
	by {cmd:svrest}
