It uses ^ksm, lowess^ to produce the smoothed plot.  Lowess          calculations on 1,000 observations, for instance, require estimating          1,000 regressions.Note: ^lprplot^ will not work if ^logistic^ was used with weights.Options--------^bwidth(^#^)^ specifies the bandwidth for smoothing.  Default is 0.8.    See help @ksm@ for details.graph_options are any of the options allowed with ^graph, twoway^.    See help @graph@.Examples---------        . ^logistic y x1 x2 x3^        . ^lprplot x3^Author-------        Bill Sribney        Stata Corporation        702 University Drive East        College Station, TX 77840        Phone: 409-696-4600               800-782-8272        Fax:   409-696-4601        email: tech_support@@stata.comReference----------Landwehr, J.M., D.
