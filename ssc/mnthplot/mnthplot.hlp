.-help for ^mnthplot^.-Scatter plot for monthly data with repetition of data-----------------------------------------------------    ^mnthplot^ yvarlist mnthvar [weight] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]    [ ^, p^ad^(^#^)^ graph_options ]Description-----------^mnthplot^ produces a scatter plot for yvarlist versus mnthvar with some repetition of data. mnthvar is presumed to take values 1,...,12 for the 12 months of the year. A pad of # months is added so that 12 + # months are shown on the horizontal axis. Showing (12 + #) / 12 annual cycles, where # is say 3 or 6, may give a better picture of seasonal variation by reducing the visual effect of the break at the end of the year. Options-------^pad(^#^)^ adds a pad of # months at the right of the horizontal axis.     Default 0. Minimum 0, maximum 12.  graph_options are any of the options allowed with ^graph, twoway^;    see help for ^graph^.Examples--------        . ^mnthplot sales month, pad(6) xla(1/18)^Author------         Nicholas J.
