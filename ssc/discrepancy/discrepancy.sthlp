{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:discrepancy} calculates Studer et al's measure of the
{it:discrepancy} of a distance matrix, grouped by a categorical variable
{it: groupvar}. The pseudo-R-squared and pseudo-F statistic are based on
the extent to which the average distance to the centres of the groups
are less than the average distance to the centre of the ungrouped
distance matrix. The p-value is based on permutations (100 by default,
but Studer et al recommend 1000 to 5000; set it to 1 for speed if you
are not interested in the p-value). {p_end}

{pstd}The distance to the centre of the group can optionally be saved in
a variable. This can be used to identify group medoids.{p_end}
