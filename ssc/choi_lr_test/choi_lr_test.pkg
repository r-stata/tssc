d 'CHOI_LR_TEST': module to perform Choi's likelihood ratio test
d
d  choi_lr_test calculates the likelihood ratio (LR) test described
d in  Choi et al. (2015). This test is conditioned on the total
d number of exposed subjects from a case-control study. The
"d following statistics, conditioned on the marginal exposure rate,"
d are also derived: the maximum likelihood estimate of the odds
d ratio for exposure in cases relative to controls; the LR under
d the null hypothesis that the odds ratio equals 1; the 1/6.8
"d likelihood support interval (LSI); and the 1/k LSI, where k is"
d specified by the user. The p-value from this LR test is
d inferentially consistent with classical tests of normally
d distributed data as well as with likelihood ratios and support
d intervals based on this conditional likelihood function. The
d 1/6.8 LSI equals the 95% confidence interval for normally
d distributed random variables. This statistic and LSI are useful
d for tables with few subjects in which the asymptotic properties
d of classical test statistics are irrelevant and Fisherâ€™s exact
d test is too conservative. It is particularly appropriate when one
d of the cells of the 2x2 table is empty.
