{title:Renames SOEP-Varlist}

{p 8 25}{cmd:soepren} {it:varlist} {cmd:,}
{cmdab:new:stub(}{it:newname}{cmd:)}
{cmdab:w:aves(}{it:numlist}{cmd:)}

{title:Description}

{p}{cmd:soepren} Renames a SOEP-Varlist into newnames formed by
newname and wave. Each newname starts with the string defined in the
option newstub() and ends with an element of the numlist in
waves(). The original names are stored as notes. 

{p} soepren is a dangerous command. It did not control that the
variables in varlist are in the right order. It only controls that the
varlist and the numlist share the same number of elements.

{p 8 12}{inp:. soepren ahhnr-khhnr, newstub(hnr) waves(84/94)}
