At least one of {cmd:eclass()} or {cmd:rclass()} must be specified.  {cmd:eclass()} must include one or more names of e-class results, as would be displayed by {cmd:estimates list} after fitting an individual model. {cmd:rclass()} must include the name of a program that would execute without arguments after a model command and one or more names of r-class results it produces.{title:Remarks}{p}The number of models fitted must not exceed the number of observations. {p}The upper limit of 6 is not a matter of principle. The limit may be changed in a future version.{p}Naturally, this command does not purport to replace the detailed scrutiny of individual models or to offer an unproblematic way of finding "best" models. Its main use may lie in demonstrating that several models existwithin many projects possessing roughly equal merit as measured by omnibus statistics. {title:Options}{p 0 4}{cmd:eclass()} specifies one or more model statistics to be tabulated. Statistics displayed by {cmd:estimates list} as {cmd:e(}{it:result}) should be specified as {it:result}. See the manual entry for whatever is {it:modelcmd}.{p 0 4}{cmd:rclass()} specifies the name of a program that would execute without arguments after a model command and one or more names of r-class results it produces. For example, users may write an r-class program to pick up  e-class results after {it:modelcmd} and compute from them one or more statistics not included in the e-class results. Statistics left behind after {it:progname} as {cmd:r(}{it:result}) should be specified as {it:result}. {p 0 4}{cmd:detail} specifies that the results of {it:modelcmd} be echoed for each individual model. This may produce a large amount of output. {p 0 4}{cmd:npmax()} specifies the maximum number of predictors to be fitted. {p 0 4}{cmd:format()} and {cmd:cellwidth()} are options of {help tabdisp}. The default values are {cmd:format(%4.3f) cellwidth(12)}. {p 0 4}{it:modelcmd_options} are other options of {it:modelcmd}. {title:Examples}{p 4 8}{inp:. gen gpm = 1 / mpg}{p_end} {p 4 8}{inp:. allpossible regress gpm head-disp, eclass(rmse r2_a)} {p 4 8}{inp:. allpossible glm mpg weight-displacement, rclass(glmcorr rmse rho jrho) link(power -1)} {title:Author}    Nicholas J.
