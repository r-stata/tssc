The pointwise confidence intervals are derived    from the running line smoother @running@.^level(^#^)^ sets the width of a pointwise confidence band for the estimated    b(t). Default: current value of system macro ^$S_level^ (usually 95%).^mean^ uses the ^mean^ option of @running@ to produce a running mean smoother.graph_options are any of Stata's ^graph, twoway^ optionsRemarks-------^stgtcalc^ implements a suggestion of Grambsch and Therneau (1994). For an xvarwith estimated regression coefficient b, ^stgtcalc^ calculates 	g(T) = b + #deaths * V^^-1 * r(T)at each failure time T, where V is the estimated dispersion matrix of theregression coefficients, #deaths is the number of uncensored observations andr(T) is the vector of Schoenfeld residuals at T. The g(T)'s are smoothed andthe smoothed values are saved. g(T) is a local estimate of beta, so the shapeof the smoothed profile may indicate whether beta depends on time. If so, thedataset has non-proportional hazards and the model will need to be refined.Note that the smoothed g(T) may be unreliable in the initial and final phasesof follow-up.  This may be partly due to lack of robustness in the smoother.The values of g(T) for each xvar are saved with names ^GT^xvar1, ^GT^xvar2, etc.If more than one xvar is to be plotted by ^stgtplot^, a panel of plots is produced.Example-------	. ^stset survtime cens^	. ^stcox x1 x2^	. ^stgtcalc^	. ^stgtplot x1^	. ^stgtplot x1 x2, ci mean^Reference---------Grambsch PM, Therneau TM.
