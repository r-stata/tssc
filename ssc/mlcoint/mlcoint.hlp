Maximum likelihood estimates of cointegration			[STB-21: sts9]---------------------------------------------	^mlcoint^ varlist [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [^, noc^onstant ^l^ags^(^#^)^			^non^ormal ^r^egress ^stand^ard ^s^tatic^(^varlist^)^ ]	^lrcotest^ varlist [^,^ ^c^ir^(^#^)^ ^r^estrict ]	^wcotest^ varlist [^,^ ^c^ir^(^#^)^ ]^mlcoint^ calculates the eigenvalues and the maximal eigenvalue and trace statistics for the VAR defined by ^varlist^.  These statistics can be used to test for the number of cointegrating vectors in the system.  If the ^normal^or ^standard^ option is specified, maximum likelihood estimates of the cointegrating vectors and of the matrix of weights are displayed.  ^mlcoint^ uses Johansen's method for computing the estimates and test statistics.  See the references for more information on the method.^lrcotest^ and ^wcotest^ are used after ^mlcoint^ to test the null hypothesisthat one or more of the variables in the VAR do not enter the cointegratingrelationship(s).  ^lrcotest^ calculates the likelihood-ratio test.  ^wcotest^calculates the Wald test.Notes-----These programs rely on programs in the Stata time series library (STB-21: sts7.4).  The time series library must be available before ^mlcoint^ , ^lrcotest^,or ^wcotest^ can be run.^mlcoint^ creates several global matrices that are used by ^lrcotest^ and ^wcotest^.These matrices have names that begin with the characters "^M_^".Options-------^c^ir^(^#^)^ indicates the number of cointegrating relationships in the system.^noconstant^ suppresses the constant in the first stage VAR.^l^ags^(^#^)^ specifies the number of lags in the original VAR (in levels).^non^ormal suppresses the display of the normalized Alpha and Beta' matrices.^r^egress indicates that the VAR estimates are to be displayed. ^r^estrict requests that ^lrcotest^ display the restricted estimates of the	eigenvalues and of the Alpha and Beta' matrices.^stand^ard requests the display of the standardized Alpha and Beta' matrices        instead of the normalized matrices.^s^tatic^(^varlist^)^ specifies static variables that enter the VAR.References----------Johansen, S. 1988.
