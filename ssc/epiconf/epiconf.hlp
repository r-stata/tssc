.-help for ^epiconf^ .-Assessing confounding effects in epidemiological studies ---------------------------------------------------------------    ^epiconf^ yvar xvar,  [^con^(covlist) ^cat^(covlist) ^m^odel(string)		^nog^raph ^b^ackward  ^e^xpos(varname) ^d^ead(varname) ^det^ail 		^l^evel(#) ^co^ef graph_options]        ^epiconf^ calculates the change in effect estimates such as odds ratio, rate ratio, or hazard ratio after adjusting for a potential confounder using either "forward selection" or "backward deletion" strategies. ^epiconf^ also calculates and graphs adjusted effect measures and their confidence intervals. The order of variables being selected is based on the "importance" (magnitude) of "change in estimate".   Variables required------------------    ^yvar^ -- dependent variable, binary variable for logistic or poisson         regression; survival time variable for Cox proportional hazards        model.      ^xvar^ -- exposure of interest         Options -------    ^con^ -- list of potential continuous confounding variables.     ^cat^ -- list of potential categorical confouding variables.     ^m^odel^(^string^)^ -- specifies the regression method, default is         logistic regression (^logit^), ^poisson^ and ^cox^ can be         specified.     ^nog^graph -- suppresses graphs. By default, a graph is given.       ^b^ackward -- specifies selection strategy as "back deletion method",         otherwise, "forward selection" method is default.    ^e^xpos(varname) -- specifies a variable that reflects the amount of         exposure over which the ^yvar^ events were observed for each         observation. This is the option only for ^poisson^ regression.          ^d^ead(varname) -- specifies the name of a variable recording 0 if         censored and nonzero -- typically 1 -- if failure. If dead() is         not specified, all observations are assumed to have failed.  This        is the option only for ^cox^ regression.    ^co^ef -- graphs regression coefficients instead of effect estimates         for graphs.    ^det^ail -- gives details at each step. Default only gives a summary.     ^l^evel(#) -- specifies the confidence level, in percent, for         calculation of confidence intervals (default=95%)          ^graph_options^ -- some options with ^graph^ are allowed; see help         @graph@.Examples-------- .  ^epiconf dead ab_uria, con(sbp weight) cat(sex agegroup)^        Calculates and graphs crude and adjusted odds ratios using        logistic regressions with a forward selection approach.          .  ^epiconf dead ab_uria, con(weight sbp) cat(sex agegroup) m(poisson)^  	^e(time) detail^        Calculates and graphs crude and adjusted rate ratios using poisson        regressions with a backward deletion method.
