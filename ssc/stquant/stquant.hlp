You must^stset^ your data before using this command; see help @stset@.Description-----------^stquant^ presents point and interval estimates of quantiles for survivaltime. Confidence intervals are obtained by two methods: large sample normaldistribution of the estimated quantile and that one proposed by Brookmeyerand Crowley. Both show limits. The first one has not yet been fully studiedand I noted some incosistencies for small samples in the right tail of thesurvivorship function. For the latter one  Authors recommend that thisinterval be used when there are no tied survival times. Options-------^by(^varname^)^ requests separate estimates for each group marked by having   equal values of the variables in varname along with an overall total.       Varname may contain just one variable which may be string or numeric.^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level, in percent, for the survival    time. Default is 95; see help @level@.^q^uant^(^#^)^ sets the quantile of survival time estimated. Default is 50.    Values allowed are from 5 to 94.Examples-------- . ^stquant, by(hercoc) l(80) q(75)^Also see--------On-line:  help for @stsum@, @sts@.Reference---------D.W.
