{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:mm_ecdf()} returns the empirical cumulative distribution
function (e.c.d.f.) of each column of {it:X}. Observations with equal values
receive the same cumulative value.

{pstd}
{cmd:mm_relrank()} evaluates the e.c.d.f of
{it:X} at the values provided by {it:Q}. That is,
{cmd:mm_relrank()} returns the relative ranks of
{it:Q} in the distribution of {it:X}. Note
that {cmd:mm_relrank()} works column by column. If
{it:Q} has one column and {it:X} has several columns, then the
relative ranks of {it:Q} are computed in each column of
{it:X}. If {it:X} has one column and {it:Q} has several columns, then the
e.c.d.f of
{it:X} is evaluated in each column of {it:Q}. If
{it:X} and {it:Q} both have several columns, then the number of
columns is required to be the same and relative ranks are
computed column by column.

{pstd}
Note that

{p 8 8 2}
 {cmd:mm_relrank(}{it:x}{cmd:,} {it:w}{cmd:,} {it:x}{cmd:)}
 = {cmd:mm_ecdf(}{it:x}{cmd:,} {it:w}{cmd:)}

{pstd}
if {it:x} is a column vector. Naturally, {cmd:mm_ecdf()} is faster.

{pstd}
{cmd:mm_ranks()} returns for each column of {it:X} the ranks of the values
in {it:X}, where the smallest values are ranked highest (i.e. rank 1
is returned for the smallest value, rank 2 for the second smallest,
etc.). Seen differently, {cmd:mm_ranks()} returns the absolute cumulative
frequency distribution of each column of {it:X} or, if {it:norm}!=0 is specified, 
the relative cumulative distribution.

{pstd}
{it:w} specifies weights associated
with the observations (rows) in {it:X}. Omit {it:w}, or specify {it:w} as 1 to
obtain unweighted results. Using {it:w}!=1 in {cmd:mm_ranks()}
does not seem to make much sense if the result is to be interpreted as
ranks. It is useful, however, to compute the absolute frequency distribution
function from weighted data.

{pstd} 
{it:mid}!=0 specifies to use midpoints in the e.c.d.f. That is, at 
each step in the distribution, the value of the midpoint of the step is 
returned. {it:mid}!=0 in {cmd:mm_relrank()} only affects the results for 
{it:Q}-values that have an exact match in {it:X}. 


{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
The formula for the empirical cumulative distribution function
implemented in {cmd:mm_ecdf()} and {cmd:mm_relrank()} is:

               { 0        if x < x(1)
        F(x) = { W(i)/W   if x(i) <= x < x(i+1), i=1,...,n-1
               { 1        if x >= x(n)

{pstd}
where x(1), x(2), ..., x(n) are the ordered observations,
W(i) is the running sum of weights, and W is the overall
sum of weights.

{pstd}The default for {cmd:mm_ranks()} is to return
ranks in random order where {it:x} is tied. Alternatively, specify {it:ties}==1
to assign the highest occurring rank to tied observations,
{it:ties}==2 to assign mean ranks, or
{it:ties}==3 to assign the lowest rank. Example:

        {com}: x = (1,2,2,3)'
        {res}
        {com}: x, mm_ranks(x,1,0), mm_ranks(x,1,1), mm_ranks(x,1,2),
        >    mm_ranks(x,1,3)
        {res}       {txt}  1     2     3     4     5
            {c TLC}{hline 31}{c TRC}
          1 {c |}  {res}  1     1     1     1     1{txt}  {c |}
          2 {c |}  {res}  2     2     2   2.5     3{txt}  {c |}
          3 {c |}  {res}  2     3     2   2.5     3{txt}  {c |}
          4 {c |}  {res}  3     4     4     4     4{txt}  {c |}
            {c BLC}{hline 31}{c BRC}{txt}

{pstd}Furthermore, {it:ties}==4 ranks tied observations in order of
{it:w} (observations with smallest weights are ranked highest). Where  
{it:w} is constant, {it:ties}==4 is equivalent to {it:ties}==0.

{pstd}Note that {cmd:mm_ecdf()} is closely related to
{cmd:mm_ranks()}. In fact:

        {cmd:mm_ecdf(x, w)} = {cmd:mm_ranks(x, w, 3, 0, 1)}

{it:w} contains missing values. Missing values in {it:X} or {it:Q} are ranked
lowest.
