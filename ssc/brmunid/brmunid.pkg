d 'BRMUNID': module to standardize geocodes for Brazilian municipalities
d
d  brmunid standardizes geocodes for Brazilian municipalities.
d Before 2006 the Brazilian government used to assign a geocode
d with an additional digit for error detection. In 2006 the system
d was abandoned and geocodes have only 6 digits ever since. When
"d applied, the program creates a new variable with standardizes"
d geocodes with only six digits. When the option sixtoseven is
d selected the program performs the opposite procedure and adds the
d extra digit.
