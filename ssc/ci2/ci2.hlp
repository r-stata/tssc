.-help for ^ci2^, ^cii2^               (STB 59 - sg159 PT Seed - paul.seed@@kcl.ac.uk).-Confidence intervals for correlations-------------------------------------	^ci2^ varname1 varname2 [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [weight] [^, COrr SPearman^]	^cii2^ #n #corr [^, corr^]Description-----------Without the ^corr^ or ^spear^ options, ^ci2^ and ^cii2^ behave as @ci@ and @cii@.With option ^corr^, ^ci2^ calculates the Pearson product moment correlation& produces a confidence interval, based on Fisher's transformation.  As with @correlate@, ^ci2^ takes frequency and analytic weights.With option ^spearman^, (with or without ^corr^), Spearman's rank correlation is used.^cii2^ is the immediate version.  There is no separate Spearman option, because the method for finding the correlation is the same in both cases.Examples--------Use for correlations  . ^ci2 colorime icp , corr^ . ^ci2 colorime icp , corr spearman^ . ^ci2 colorime icp , spearman^(Note: these last two are effectively the same.) . ^cii2 78 .52 , corr^			(78 paired observations, correlation 0.52)Use as ^ci^ and ^cii^ . ^ci2 mpg^ . ^ci2 mpg price, level(90)^ . ^ci2 promoted, binomial^ . ^ci2 count, poisson^ . ^ci2 deaths, exposure(pyears)^ . ^cii2 166 19509 4379^                 (166 obs, mean=19509, sd=4379) . ^cii2 166 19509 4379, level(90)^ . ^cii2 10 1^                           (10 binomial events, 1 observed success) . ^cii2 1 27, poisson^                  (27 Poisson events observed)Also see-------- Manual: [R] correlateOn-line: @correlate@, @pwcorr@
