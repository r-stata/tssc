d 'STAK': module to do simple reshapes or stacks
d
d stak vertically stacks the variables in varlist into a single new
d  variable and has options for retaining the varlist and other
d variables in the data set.  The emphasis is simplicity: no data
d preparation is required; no options are required; and all options
d have extremely short abbreviations.
