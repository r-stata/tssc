d 'TUPLES': module for selecting all possible tuples from a list
d
"d  tuples produces a set of local macros, each containing a list of"
d  the names defining a tuple selected from a given list. By
"d default  the set of macros is complete, other than the tuple"
d containing no  selections. By default the given list is tried as
"d a variable list,  but if it is not a variable list any other kind"
"d of list is  acceptable, except that no other expansion is carried"
d out. All  these defaults can be overridden.
