A rejection of the null indicates that endogenous regressors' effects on the estimates are meaningful, and instrumental variables techniques are required. The test was first proposed by Durbin (1954) and separately by Wu (1973) (his T4 statistic) and Hausman (1978). This "Durbin-Wu-Hausman" (DWH) test is numerically equivalent to the standard "Hausman test" obtained using {help hausman} with the sigmamore option, in which both forms of the model must be estimated. Under the null, it is distributed Chi-squared with m degrees of freedom, where m is the number of regressors specified as endogenous in the original instrumental variables regression.{p}The {cmd:ivendog} output also contains another test statistic: the "Wu-Hausman"T2 statistic of Wu (1973). Hausman (1978) showed that the test could becalculated straightforwardly through the use of auxiliary regressions.The test statistic, under the null, is distributed F(m,N-k), where m is the number of regressors specified as endogenous in the original instrumental variables regression. A rejection indicates that the instrumental variables estimator should be employed. See Davidson and MacKinnon (1993, p. 237-240) and Wooldridge (2000, p. 483-484). {p}If the constant was excluded from {cmd:ivreg} or {cmd:ivreg2}, it will be excluded from the auxiliary regression.{p}As Davidson and MacKinnon (1993, p. 241-242) discuss, the test may be applied to a subset of the endogenous variables, maintaining those not specified as endogenous. In this form, the {it:varlist} contains those variableswhich are to be tested, and the degrees of freedom for the test refer to thenumber of variables listed.{p}These tests may also be computed by the orthog option of {cmd:ivreg2}. Although {cmd:ivendog} may not be applied to robust nor cluster estimates,{cmd:ivreg2} may also be used to perform a heteroskedasticity-robust form of the test in either context, as well as in the GMM context.{p}The underlying computations for these tests are described in much greaterdetail in Baum, Schaffer, and Stillman (2003).{title:Examples}{p 8 12}{inp:. use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/wooldridge/mroz, clear}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. ivreg lwage exper expersq (educ = motheduc fatheduc)}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. ivendog}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. ivreg lwage (exper educ = motheduc fatheduc huseduc)}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. ivendog}{p_end}{p 8 12}{inp:. ivendog exper}{p_end}{title:References}{p 0 4}Baum, C.
